            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Good Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat ever becoms of the Controverſie yet depending, or on which
ſide ſoever the truth ſhall fall concerning the intention of God
the Father in the death of his Son, and the nature and kind
of his Decrees, to be ſure the law of life eſtabliſhed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
is both inviolable and irreverſible herein, that the crown of life it muſt
be run for; and it is not a ſeeking, but a ſtriving, that muſt carry it. It's true
what the Wiſeman ſaith, that <hi>knowledge is eaſie to him that will underſtand,</hi>
yet not to every looſe or faint deſire, but to the ſtrength of ſuch a will, which
through deſire doth ſeparate it ſelf to intermeddle with all wiſdome. For, it is
with truth the off-spring of the God of truth, as it is with God himſelf; who
though he be light, and in him there is no darkneſſe at all, yet is he ſaid ſomtimes
to make darkneſſe his pavilion round about him, and to veile the light of his glory
till we ſeek him diligently: Even ſuch is the nature of truth, eſpecially of ſuch
which are inriched with excellency, and have a proper tendency to inrich the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
accordingly, there is a holy diſdain and ſecret digret in them (as it were)
to be beheld, or looked upon with common thoughts and apprehenſions, but they
do require a ſingularneſſe of intention, and raiſedneſſe of mind and ſpirit, to go
forth to meet them. Nothing fills the world in generall with more complaints at
this day, nor the Commonwealth of Chriſtians in particular with more diviſions,
and thereupon with great thoughts of heart, then the diverſity of opinions or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
rather concerning <hi>Truth.</hi> Which notwithstanding, did not the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and affected ignorance of ſome, the petulancy and frowardneſſe of others,
and the ſupine negligence and remiſneſſe of most too much indulge and cheriſh,
might have received a great allay before this. <hi>Buy the truth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) but
ſell it not: Earneſtly contend for the faith</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which was once
delivered unto the Saints:</hi> And precious is our Saviours advice, <hi>Call no man Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
upon earth, for one is your Maſter which is in heaven.</hi> Too excellent above
meaſure is the nature of the ſoule to be ſubjugated to the lawes and edicts of men;
No, it muſt confeſſe its ſoveraigne Lord, from whom it received its being, and at
whoſe will and pleaſure it muſt be for ever. And too invaluable is that pearle of
price (the truth of the Goſpell) to be found without much ſeeking, yea without
much ſearching and inquiring after. Which being ſo, doth add much weight
and worth to this and ſuch like ingagaments, and pleads their righteouſneſſe and
equity with a lip of excellency. For ſhould that queſtion now be reſumed againe
and put to many, which was ſomtime put to Christ, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> I meane in
the particularities of it as they have been received and acknowledged, doubtleſſe,
many pretenders to this underſtanding would fall ſhort in point of anſwer,
<pb facs="tcp:114759:3"/>
daily experience in all ages witneſſing and ſealing to it, (which in ſome meaſure
(me thinks) ſhould heal the offence which comes by it) that as one Generation
paſſeth, and another comes, the former reſigning up, and giving place to the
latter; ſo thoſe Conceptions of Truth which have lookt very lovely for a ſeaſon,
after a time they have loſt their beauty, the ſhining of a clearer light detecting
them of weakneſſe, and expelling them as darkneſſe; for though <hi>the night be far
paſt, and the day at hand,</hi> yet ſuch is the nature of Truth, as that of Light, to
ſhine yet more and more unto the perfect day. What thou hast here preſented to thy
view, I nothing doubt but thou didſt either here, or els haſt heard of, the ſound of
it having gone forth both far and neare, neither was it done in a corner. The
ground and reaſon of the firſt originall writing was mainly this, to preſerve the
honour of Truth in the diſcovery and manifestation of it, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of the ingaged Parties, or otherwiſe to recover their innocency from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that ſlander and calumny, which ignorance and prejudice might be apt to caſt
upon them, upon ſuch ingagements, experience whereof hath been too manifeſt in
this particular, through too much credulity (that epidemicall weakneſſe of many)
to believe every thing. That thou waſt no ſooner prevented with it, the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of indiſpenſible occaſions otherwiſe muſt plead for it. Take it as it was, or
well could be taken without further Rhetorick or Arethmetick, not the leaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
addition, or Substraction, onely ſome impertinent Multiplication, firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
and then cancell'd. And this be pleaſed to take not upon a ſingle accompt,
but upon a three-fold teſtimony: firſt duely comparing, conſenting, and agreeing
in one. That which I ſhall further add in reference to it is onely this, the nature
of the ſubject my hope is, will command an excellency of engagement, and the
formall manner of tranſacting (ſo rarely ſeen or known in this our generation)
no doubt but will add ſome further weight to the conſideration of it: beware of
prejudice that great enemy of Truth and perverter of Juſtice. Labour with thy
ſelf what thou canſt to behold a double object with a ſingle eye. Look not in an
oblique manner or angularly upon the perſons, but with a direct and full aſpect
upon their reſpective Arguments and Concluſions: take heed of raſh and haſty
inferences from inconſiderate and indigeſted premiſes. Firſt read, and then judge,
and afterwards give ſentence.</p>

               <p>I would make known to you, and to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
my thoughts both in relation to my ſelf, and to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in hand.</p>
               <p>1. In relation to my ſelf, I ſpeak it in the preſence of the Lord,
his Angells, and People, who are preſent, that my thoughts were
not in the leaſt to contend with you, Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> or with any
of yours, out of any prejudice that I have to your perſon, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection;
for, God knowes how much I did love and reſpect
you, and ſtill do.</p>
               <p>2. My thoughts, in bringing about the laſt meeting, were not
to ingage in the way of diſpute, but to come together and to
diſcourſe in a way of love and meekneſſe, and to receive ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
one from another in thoſe things wherein we differ.</p>
               <p>3. In relation to my ſelf, I look upon my ſelf as others do, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unable and unfit to withſtand M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in a way of diſpute,
and therefore ſhould be glad that others, who are fitter and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
read in the controverſie, would undertake the work.</p>
               <p>4. If we ſhall do any thing this day in theſe particulars, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to do it with the ſpirit of love, according to the Goſpell,
not ſtriving who ſhall have the conqueſt, but to cleare up the
truth, for the glory of God, and the ſatisfaction of his people;
not to fall into bitterneſſe one againſt another: I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
(if I can) to reſtrain my own corruption; and ſo that God
may not ſuffer diſhonor, no matter what becoms of me: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that he may be glorified in me, though I go away with
ſhame.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>There is no man that ſhall exchange his opinion
(ſuppoſing it to be an error for a truth) that ſhall need to ſay
or fear that he ſhall ſuffer ſhame, that God may be glorified in
him: for, the truth is, that he himſelf ſhall receive glory as well
as God, by every ſuch exchange: and certainly it is the greateſt
gain that any perſon under heaven (how great ſoever in wiſdom
and knowledg otherwiſe) can make, to make an exchange of his
droſſe for ſilver, and of that which pollutes his conſcience, for
that which will make it ſhine, and that like to an Angel of God,
which is by receiving and embracing the truth: And therefore
upon that account we need not fear ſuffering of ſhame, or any
diſparagement, if we ſhall be convinced of errour in our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114759:4"/>
certainly it will be the beſt Market that ever we came
at, the beſt bargain that ever we made in our lives.</p>
               <p>And whereas you ſpeak of your intention in the laſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if there had not been ſomething precedent to it on your
part, which made the acceptation of it more unworthy of you,
I ſhould have been glad to have heard thoſe words from you:
But if your deſire and intent was to find out whether you or I
had truth with us, you on your ſide, or I on mine, you ſhould
have done well to have forborne thoſe undue (I may ſay) words,
whereby you did aſperſe both me, and thoſe that relate to me
in this way; I cannot ſay in publike, as in the Pulpit, or upon the
Exchange, but before many, and to cenſure and adjudge men,
or to reflect any thing in an oblique manner by way of diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
before you know whether guilt, or any ſuch unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
or no be found with them, I conceive it was not faire
nor Chriſtian, otherwiſe I approve of what you ſay, and deſire
you ſo much grace from God, that you may keep up cloſe to
thoſe ingagements, and not be a tranſgreſſor of your owne
Law.</p>

to what we now meet upon, we came then to this conſideration,
to find out ſome men ſound in the Faith for the diſpatch of ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
then under conſideration, and deſiring to know who they were,
M. <hi>Powell</hi> was pleaſed to reply to me, That he did not judge them
who hold the Doctrine of Free-will, and falling from grace, as ſound
in the Faith: To that I replyed, If you have any thing to ſay to me
touching any ſuch thing, I hope I ſhould give a Chriſtian account of
it; and at last it came to this, that he profeſt he heard that I held
ſuch and ſuch things, and that many godly and good Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
many ſtrange things to be held by M. <hi>Goodwin.</hi> I anſwered,
that we had very hard meaſure from many of our Congregationall
Brethren, we had indeed their good words for us, but we did find that
our credit and repute was much undermined by them: We did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
before aſſociation of Churches, though we did not practiſe it,

M. <hi>Powell</hi> did ſpeak a word that might a little reflect upon your

               <p>That was not my propoſition, but the one half
of it was; for ſince this meeting was to ſatisfie you in what I
hold, (ſuppoſing my judgement to be erroneous, and yours or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox

to lay down your opinion which is contrary to mine, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
your proofs from Scripture one after another, that ſo we
may ſee whether they will amount to the confirmation thereof,
yea, or no.</p>

kept from it. Secondly, if any one hath any thing to ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>This then is my judgment and doctrine touching
the point of Gods intention in the death of Chriſt, or in the
matter of redemption and ſalvation; I ſay it down thus:</p>
               <p>That God did intend, or the intention of God in the death of
Chriſt was, that all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity ſhould be ſaved and redeemed.</p>
               <p>This doctrine I thus explain, and this is my ſenſe in it. When
I affirm, that the intention of God was that all <hi>Adams</hi> poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ſhould be ſaved, I attribute intentions to God only in ſuch a
ſenſe as he is capable of intending any thing, or wherein
they are appropriable or attributable to him, which ſenſe is this;
Suppoſing God to be a moſt pure, ſimple, undivided and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Eſſence in himſelf, not capable of any multiplicity, or plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of actions, but remaining unchangeable every way, he
doth not intend things after the manner of creatures; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
I explain thus: A man when he intends any thing, the act
of his mind by which his intention is produced, it is eſſentially
diſtinct from his eſſence and being, and from the nature of his
ſoul, ſo that his ſoul is one thing, and his intention another; but
now in attributing intentions to God, I do not conceive that his
intention is one thing, and God himſelf another; but he is ſaid
to intend things, becauſe he puts forth himſelf by means of that
infinite perfection of his being after ſuch a manner, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to paſſe of ſuch and ſuch effects, as men do when they intend
any thing. For example; When a man intends any thing, this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114759:7"/>
in his courſe, he projects meanes, or ſets afoot and ingageth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in ſuch or ſuch a way for the effecting of what he intends,
which is apt and proper to effect it: And in this ſenſe I affirm,
that God intends the ſalvation of all, becauſe he affords &amp; exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
means proper for the ſalvation of all by the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore, by the way, it will not follow, that in caſe the
ſalvation of all men be not actually effected, that therefore God
failes and miſcarries in his intention; and the reaſon is, becauſe
what ever is attributed to God which is borrowed from men, as
wiſdom, love, hatred, and a thouſand ſuch things, they are onely
attributed to him by way of effect, and not by way of affect, or of
any formall exiſtence or being in God; for there is no ſuch thing
as love, or hatred, or wiſdome in him, to ſpeak properly; but
God by means of his pure and ſimple Eſſence, he is theſe, and all
theſe, eminently and tranſcendently; but none of them formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is, in ſuch a propriety of their ſeverall natures, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are found in men and in Angells too; they are not in the
divine nature upon any ſuch account as they are in men: So that
when we ſay God intends the ſalvation of all men, we ſuppoſe
that God doth that, or behaves himſelf upon ſuch terms, and in
ſuch a way as men do when they intend any thing: Yet not ſo,
that God doth all things, or every thing that men do under
their intentions; it is ſufficient (according to the common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Divines) that ſimilitudes are good and ſerviceable to
their end, if they hold in any one particular, though they fal ſhort
and vary in a thouſand others. As for example; If God doth any
one thing by means of the death of Chriſt, which men are wont
to do ordinarily upon their intentions, then I ſuppoſe the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is true, and will ſtand good, <hi>That God did intend the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of all.</hi> And therefore as men, when they intend many
things, they do not alwayes intend them upon the higheſt, and
moſt abſolute termes, but they may really and truly be ſaid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them, if they can be obtained by ſuch and ſuch means: As
for example; To purchaſe a houſe, a man may intend it, if he
can have it upon reaſonable terms, and ſuch as become a prudent
man to give for it; but it doth not follow, that therfore he will
give out of reaſon for it, or ſuch a price that ſhall declare him to
be a fool, or a man inconſiderate in his way. And ſo God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114759:7"/>
the ſalvation of all by the death of Chriſt, ſo far as to give
means unto all, which are equitable and agreeable to his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for their ſalvation: not that he doth intend by way of
decree; for, the decrees of God, if we take the word ſtrictly,
they are abſolute and unchangeable, and he will ingage his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power to effect them; as, the reſurrection of the dead, and
the glorification of all thoſe who ſhall live and die in the faith
of his Son, theſe are ſo decreed by God, that all the interpoſings
of all creatures can never hinder the execution of them. But
now thoſe things which are properly intended by God, they are
not intended ſo to be procured, as by the omnipotency of his
arme, and the exerting and putting forth of his mighty
power to the utmoſt, but by ſuch meanes as are agreeable
to his wiſdome, and to that kinde of creature whoſe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is intended by him. And this is the cleare ſenſe of
my opinion touching the intention of God about the death of
Chriſt.</p>

               <p>It was not propounded for any ſuch end, that
you ſhould anſwer it; for I have onely aſſerted, I have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any thing. But I will anſwer your Queſtion,</p>
               <p>Whether God intends the ſalvation of all men abſolutely or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally?</p>
               <p>This then I ſay, that in a ſenſe, and true ſtating of all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114759:8"/>
the decrees and counſells of God, I hold that they are all abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and independent upon any thing in the creature, that is,
that God ſhould intend the ſalvation of all men, in ſuch a ſenſe
as I have declared; this purpoſe and intention of his was not
occaſioned or brought into him by any interpoſall, or conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the creature, but it was meerly drawne out of his
own will, and proceeded from his own grace and bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
in this ſenſe all the intentions of God are abſolute. But
now if by abſolute you mean, that God will fulfill and put in
execution the thing intended without any condition, ſo I ſay,
they are not abſolute but conditionall; for God doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the ſalvation of any man, but only by the interpoſall of his
faith and believing. Now if you pleaſe to let me go on, I ſhall
produce my argument, and if it doth not reach home to my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
as I have laid it down, take notice of the defect, and we
will eeke it out.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That God hath intended the ſalvation of all men:</hi>
And we ſhall firſt begin with that known Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16.
<hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting
life.</hi> From hence I argue thus: If ſo be that love out of which
God gave his Son, was uniform unto the world, that is, unto
all men, then God did intend (in the death of his Son) the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of all men, and we might add, with uniformity of inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but I ſhall not need: But there he Evangeliſt expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
that God gave his Son out of that love which he bare
unto the world, that is, unto all men, and that for this end that
upon their believing they might be ſaved: therefore he did intend
in the gift of his Son, the ſalvation of all men.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Powell</speaker>
               <p>repeated the Argument, and anſwered thus: Firſt,
your major propoſition; the world is taken in Scripture not
only for all the world, that is, every particular man, and for all
the Elect, but ſeverall other wayes: But I come to your minor,
and ſay, that by the world in this place is meant the Elect of
God.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>If by the world is meant the Elect of God only,
then the ſenſe of the place muſt run thus; <hi>So God loved the Elect
of God, that whoſoever of theſe Elect of God ſhould believe, they
ſhould not periſh, but, &amp;c.</hi> Which clearly implies, that ſome of
the Elect of God will not believe, and ſo conſequently may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;
but this is to put a non-ſenſe upon the place, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the ſavor that is in it; and therefore cannot be the ſenſe
of it, as taken in this argument, that which deſtroyeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the ſentence, and the ſavor which is in it, (which
alone is fit to feed the underſtanding of a man) that cannot be
the ſenſe of the place; but now to underſtand the word [world]
in this place of the Elect only, it makes the ſenſe altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
and ſenſeleſſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi>

               <p>To this Argument I anſwer, that this may be the
ſenſe of the word [world] and the words may as well be read
thus: <hi>So God loved his Elect, that he gave,</hi> &amp;c. that ſuch and ſuch
may be ſaved, that is, that they for whom he gave Jeſus Chriſt,
might believe, and ſo be ſaved; for the Lord did not onely love
them, but he intended to bring them to believe, and ſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
of his love and of believing, they are as large the one as
the other, God ſo loved the Elect, that he would give them faith
and ſave them.</p>

               <p>I do not underſtand your anſwer, but either you
mean by the [world] the Elect only, or elſe more then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
or all mankind in generall; but ſay I, neither of the former
ſenſes can be meant, neither the Elect only, nor ſome others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114759:9"/>
the Elect, but onely the whole poſterity of <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Powell.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay by the word [world] in this place is meant
the Elect only, becauſe the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>God [ſo] loved the
world,</hi> he puts a [ſo] upon it: Now you never find that God
in Scripture is ſaid to love all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> with ſuch
a love, which is here called a loving of them [ſo] and which is
called (in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.) a great love.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>The Scripture holds forth a twofold love of God:
Firſt, a generall love which is attributed to him in reſpect of all
his creatures, and ſecondly, a more particular and ſpeciall love,
that is, to thoſe who have behaved themſelves according to his
Will and Word, by believing in his Son, and ſo by faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
continue to the end: And whereas you conceive that
this particle [ſo] here in the Text, is only augmentative, that
it only declares the greatneſſe of the love of God, this I abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
deny; for together with the greatneſſe of this love it
doth modifie and reſtrain it, and reduce it to this forme and
tenor of love: it is not ſaid ſimply, ſo God loved the world,
that he gave his Son, that all the world ſhould be ſaved, then
indeed it had been only augmentative; but mark the condition
which comes in, upon which God loved the world, and intends
to ſave it, <hi>viz.</hi> that whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved: Which
ſhewes that this particle [ſo] is not onely intenſive, and doth
not only ſtand there to declare the greatneſſe and tranſcendency
of the love of God to the world, but the tenor and the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, how and upon what termes God loved the world,
<hi>viz.</hi> that he gave his Son Jeſus Chriſt ſo and upon ſuch termes
only, that whoſoever <hi>believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have
everlaſting life.</hi>

               <p>You affirm theſe two things, that there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and a ſpeciall love in God, and when you ſpeak of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
you ſpeak of it as extending to all the creatures: But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
when you ſpeak of a ſpeciall love, you ſeem to ſay
that it is not a ſpeciall love which this word [ſo] holds out:
but I ſay, this is a ſpeciall love, my reaſon is this, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
when he ſpeaketh of this very love (in the 5. of the <hi>Rom.</hi>)
he ſaith, that God commendeth his love towards us, that whilſt
we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us. This Scripture explains
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114759:9"/>
the other, and this muſt of neceſſity be ſpeciall love.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>If by ſpeciall you mean great and wonderfull,
and ſo forth, ſo I grant it is a ſpeciall love; but if you meane
ſuch a love or affection in God, which is expreſt or born by him
towards thoſe that do actually believe, ſo that place in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
doth not hold forth or ſpeak of any ſuch love; for the
love of God is generall, and he commends it exceedingly and
marvellouſly herein, but yet it was a love ſo limited and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by God, that no perſons ſhould partake of the fruit of it,
but thoſe that ſhould believe. And further, this condition which
God puts upon the partaking of the fruit of his love, doth
not repreſent his love the leſſe commendable, or leſſe worthy of
him, God doth not ſhew himſelf leſſe loving hereby, but onely
declares himſelf herein to be a God as well of wiſdome, as of
love, and it is his wiſdome that doth moderate and ſteer all
his Attributes in all their iſſuings and goings forth unto the
world: Now it had not been a love worthy of God ſo infinite
in wiſdome and goodneſſe towards thoſe whom ye call the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
that they ſhould partake of the benefit of this love, but in,
and by, and upon their believing.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Powell.</speaker>
               <p>From this I gather two things: Firſt, that the
ſpeciall love of God is towards men that are believers, and that
upon conditions of believing: And ſecondly, you ſay, that that
is the meaning of the Apoſtle in the Romans.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>No, that I do not, but the contrary, and that
it is the ſame with that which is here ſpoken of; for it's ſaid,
<hi>that whilſt we were yet ſinners, God ſent his Son to die for us,</hi> and I
ſay that the intention of God in this love of his, and in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
expreſſion of it in the gift of his Son, it was that men
ſhould not partake of the compleat fruit and benefit of it but
upon the terms and condition of believing.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Powell.</speaker>
               <p>Let us keep to this, either the love of God is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
or common love, if it was a ſpeciall love, then it is a love to
all, or unto ſome; if to all, then you muſt prove it, if to ſome,
then it muſt be tied to the Elect of God.</p>

               <p>I gave you clearly my ſenſe before, that there is
an ambiguity in the word ſpeciall, if by that you mean great,
wonderfull, and admirable, ſo as to affect the heart, and to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114759:10"/>
the ſouls of men, ſo both this and that in the <hi>Romans</hi> are
the ſpeciall love of God; but if you mean by it ſuch a love, or
ſuch expreſſions of love from God which are peculiar and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
only to believers, ſo I ſay the love of God is not
meant, neither in this place nor in that.</p>

               <p>I conceive that in both theſe places he meanes a
ſpeciall love in the latter ſenſe; for the Evangeliſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
do intend this ſpeciall love to the Elect, and my reaſon is
this, becauſe God in the Scriptures holds forth no ſpeciall love
at all, but unto ſuch perſons.</p>

               <p>That is not at all in the Question, whether the love

be oppoſed to generall.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Powell.</speaker>
               <p>When I ſpeak of ſpeciall love, I mean not ſpeciall

               <p>The Scripture doth not take knowledge, or hold
forth any ſpeciall love in your ſenſe to any but only unto thoſe
that are actuall believers: As for all others, whom you term the
<hi>elect of God,</hi> before their faith, the Scripture ſtill wraps them up
in the ſame generall term of <hi>the world. The whole world lieth in
wickedneſſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>John.</hi> Now in this word <hi>world,</hi> certainly there
were more elect in your ſenſe that did afterwards believer, then
at the preſent, els all the labour and preaching of the Apoſtles
had been in vain: And therefore for the elect who do not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
believe, they are no where preſented in the Scripture as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part or fellowſhip of the ſpeciall love of God, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to believers, but they are bound up in the common
bundle of the world, and they are enemies to God, and God an
enemy to them, in ſuch a ſenſe as to wicked men.</p>

               <p>Give me leave to anſwer unto this. You ſay, that
if we mean a ſpeciall love, that is, ſuch a love as God beare unto
believers, that then there is no ſuch love in God but unto actuall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114759:10"/>
believers. Now I deny this, and affirm that there is the ſame love
in God towards others that are elect, who are not believers, as
there is to thoſe who actually believe: And this I prove from
two Scriptures, <hi>Jer. 31. 31. I have loved thee with an everlasting
love,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. Jacob <hi>have I loved, &amp;c.</hi> and now from hence
I will argue thus, That love which theſe two texts hold forth, it
is a ſpeciall love, and it is towards perſons that were not actuall
believers.</p>

                  <hi>M. Goodwin's</hi> argument formerly was to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
That the love of God was the motive to the giving of Chriſt, is
extended unto the world, and therefore the giving of Christ muſt
likewiſe concern the world. <hi>M. Powell's</hi> Anſwer was, that by the world
is meant onely the elect: this was took away thus, that ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the word would take away the ſavor and ſenſe of the
Scripture. Now <hi>M. Powell</hi> ſhould have given an anſwer to this,
and proved that the love of God in that place is meant of a ſpeciall
love. Now I deſire you to have reſpect to this word world, where
your Argument chiefly conſists, and prove that the word world in a

               <p>I beſeech you conſider the words, <hi>God ſo loved

Now if by the [world] you will underſtand the Elect, then the
ſenſe muſt run thus, God ſo loved the Elect, that whoſoever of
theſe Elect ſhould believe, ſhould not periſh, &amp;c. For this word
[whoſoever] is a diſtributive word, it muſt diſtribute ſome, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Elect or all men; therefore the meaning muſt needs be,
that God ſo loved the world, that whoſoever they be, whether
Elect or not Elect, that ſhall believe, they ſhall be ſaved: And
if you look your beſt Expoſitors, many of them do interpret the
word [world] as I do, univerſally; <hi>Muſculus</hi> and others.</p>

either the Elect, or all men, or elſe ſome middle ſort of

               <p>Mind the words again, <hi>God ſo loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that [whoſoever] believeth in
him,</hi> &amp;c. That which I am to prove is, that (to make ſenſe of
the place) the word <hi>whoſoever</hi> muſt diſtribute ſome men, either
the Elect or all men, or ſome other number of men between both.
If you deny that, it muſt be diſtributive, then find a Subſtantive
to the Adjective, who doth God meane when he ſaith <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever?</hi>
doth he not mean what man ſoever?</p>

               <p>Anſwer punctually to M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Argument,
which is, that the word <hi>whoſoever</hi> is a distributive word, dividing
the ſubject ſpoken of into two parts, and therefore the word <hi>world</hi>

               <p>For my part I have ſpoken what is my judgement
and conſcience in the thing, that the words may be rendered
thus, without deſtroying the ſenſe of them, <hi>God ſo loved the world,
&amp;c.</hi> that whoſoever believeth or ſhall believe: Now <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi>
that word may have relation to the world, that is, unto the

ſenſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>Do but ſee now and view it your ſelf, whether this
be a commodious ſenſe worthy to faſten upon the Holy Ghoſt,
to ſpeak at ſuch a rate; God ſo loved the world of the elect, that
whoſoever of the elect ſhould believe, ſhould not periſh, but &amp;c.
and whether this interpretation doth not clearely ſuppoſe that
there is a poſſibility that ſome of theſe elect may periſh? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
els doth he interpoſe that clauſe, that <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall
not periſh?</hi> For, taking your notion of election, there election
gives them a perfect and abſolute right to ſalvation; inſomuch
that there needs neither dying on Chriſts part, nor believing on
their part, to give them a right thereunto. If they were elected
from eternity, what greater or fuller title can there be to any
creature, or right to ſuch a poſſeſſion or inheritance as ſalvation
is, then the peremptory and abſolute deſignation of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?
Salvation is Gods, to give to whom he pleaſe, and if he do
it to any perſons ſimply and abſolutely, as they are his Elect they
ſhould be ſaved, whether they believed or no, I only add this to
ſhew the nonſenſe of ſuch a conſtruction of the words.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Powell.</speaker>
               <p>To make it appear, that it is not nonſenſe, I illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
it thus: The <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> ſuppoſe they make
ſuch a promiſe to the Army, or unto others, that whoever takes
the Ingagement they ſhal be protected by their power, and ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it they come under their protection; but now will you
ſay that of neceſſity it muſt be ſuppoſed here, that ſome will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to take this ingagement.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Good.</speaker>
               <p>I go along with your ſimilitude ſo far, that God makes
a Propoſition as the Parliament to the Army &amp; others, that is, to
all the world, that whoſoever takes the ingagement, that is, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
they ſhal be protected, <hi>i.e.</hi> they ſhal be ſaved: this now is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory,
&amp; hath ſubſtance in it, it feeds the underſtanding of a man:
But now if the Parliament had ſuch a power over the wills of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114759:12"/>
ſome particular men, as to cauſe them to take this Ingagement,
and know certainly that no others would take it, then to make
ſuch a propoſall to them, that whoſoever will take it they ſhall
be protected, this would not be a Propoſition worthy of
them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Cranford.</speaker>
               <p>The point which you are to prove, is, That there
is an abſurdity in this ſenſe, to ſay, that God ſo loved the elect, that
all the elect believing ſhall be ſaved; the ground which you give of
the abſurdity is this, becauſe according to the judgement of <hi>M. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi>
the decree of Election is ſuch, that there is no need of the death of
Chriſt, nor believing, to bring them to ſalvation.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>That was a thing which I added by the way; but
to paſſe that, God hath made ſuch a decree, that none (though
elect) ſhould be ſaved, but in and through believing, he hath
linked together Faith and Election.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. John Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall deſire (<hi>M. Powell</hi> being now to anſwer)
that he would not ſpeak ſo largely as he doth, but only deny <hi>M. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
Propoſition, and put him to prove it; for the thing is yet to
prove, that there is nonſenſe in that ſaying, and it's that which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
will not be proved theſe ſeven years.</p>

               <p>If I have no ſenſe, nor taſt of nonſenſe, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
you may, if not, I cannot relieve you, nor you me as yet, and
therefore let us read the words again, <hi>So God loved the world,
that,</hi> &amp;c. that all believing in him ſhould not periſh, but, &amp;c.
Now to make the words run thus, or to give this ſenſe of them,
ſo God loved his Elect, that every one of theſe Elect who ſhall
believe, or believing they ſhall not periſh, this (I ſay) is compleat
nonſenſe, neither can you bring any inſtance out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor from any approved Author, that was but in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſes, that did ever build ſuch a piece of conſtruction as
this is.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Caryll.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt not but there will be a very good ſenſe in it, to
ſay thus, that God ſo loved the world, (that is, the elect) that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
believeth, or that all believing, ſhould not periſh, but, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it
is but the carrying on of the ſame thing from one act unto another,
from the act of God unto the act of man; the act of God is his love,
and the giving of Jeſus Chriſt for the redemption of his elect; now
becauſe thoſe ſhall never attain the end, they ſhall never reach to that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114759:12"/>
redemption which was intended for them without believing, therefore
Chriſt puts in that, ſo that you must carry it on as to the compleaning
of the perſon who ſhall inherit that eſtate.</p>

which you gave of it, God ſhewes his love to his elect in appointing
them the means of their ſalvation, God modifies that love in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to ſalvation through believing, he ſo loveth his elect, that
all they by believing ſhall be ſaved.</p>

               <p>I do not ſay it is needleſſe to be added, it is you
that make it needleſſe: And for any man to ſay that the Holy

the words, this is contrary to the duty of an interpreter.</p>

               <p>You have ſpent much time in this thing: M. Goodwin
ſaith, that if by the world be meant the elect, then either it is poſſible
that ſome of the elect may periſh, or els there is no waight or import to
be found in theſe words [<hi>ſhall not periſh</hi>] more then is in thoſe other
[<hi>ſhall have everlaſting life.] M. Powell</hi> ſaith there is a gradation,
he <hi>ſhall not periſh, but ſhall have everlaſting life.</hi> I conceive there
are other Arguments, which poſſibly may be more to the purpoſe, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you pleaſe leave this, and paſſe to another.</p>

               <p>M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> I onely deſire this one thing, whilſt you
ſay the word [<hi>whoſoever</hi>] muſt needs be a diſtributive, that you
would conſider the two Verſes before, whether it be a diſtributive there
or no, v. 14. <hi>&amp; 15. And as</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the

               <p>You made the diſtribution before of the world, and
here before he ſpeaks any thing of a generality, having ſaid, the Son of
Man was lifted up not for theſe, or theſe, or for mankind in generall,
he comes in with theſe words, that (<hi>whoſoever) believeth in him

made of it, then all mankind, even all the poſterity of <hi>Adam:</hi>

               <p>To deny the ſenſe of the word world to be the
generality of men, it renders the carriage of the place altogether
nonſenſe, as hath been ſhewed already by ſeverall arguments:
And if you will, we will add another from the following verſe,
v. 15. <hi>God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but
that the world through him might be ſaved:</hi> (This is not an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I confeſſe, of ſuch abſolute demonſtration, but of marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
great probability that the word world is taken and meant
in the ſame ſenſe in both the clauſes.) Now if this cannot be the
ſenſe of it, that God ſent his Son into the world to condemne
the elect, then by the word world in the former verſe is not
meant the elect.</p>

of God, and do apprehend that we have an Ordinance of
God in hand.</p>
               <p>I know there are ſome weak Objections which ſome bring
againſt what I now ſay, as firſt, that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. where
he commands that all things be done without diſputings, and
that in the 1. of <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. where he ſpeaks againſt perverſe
diſputings: But the anſwer is eaſie, that he doth not
ſpeak in either of theſe places againſt his own practiſe, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe Diſputations which proceed from perverſneſſe
and corruption in the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>Another thing that ſome will object is this, that the weak are
not to be admitted to doubtfull Diſputations, and therfore
not to ſuch a conference or diſpute as this is: To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That when the Apoſtle ſpeaks againſt the admitting
of weak Chriſtians to doubtfull Diſputations, hee ſpeakes
of thoſe Diſputations which concerne not things fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
But the point which we are upon is of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a fundamentall point in Religion, the ground of
Faith, what it is that every man and woman muſt believe,
that they may be ſaved: As, whether they are to believe
that Chriſt died with an intention to ſave all the Poſterity
of <hi>Adam;</hi> or, whether he died to ſave ſinners indefinitely, that
<hi>whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but</hi> &amp;c. and therefore I
conceive that Objection will not at all prejudice our practiſe at
this time.</p>
               <p>A third Objection is this, That there are ſuch inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
uſually amongſt the people at ſuch conferences,
that it were a great deale better to let them alone, then
for godly men to ingage in them. To this I anſwer:
That this is the fault of the people, and not of the
duty; and I hope, your ingenuity will be ſuch at this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114759:18"/>
time, and your Chriſtianity, that ye will be able by
your demeanure to confute this objection; I hope you
will remember that ye are Chriſtians the moſt of ye, and
that ye ought in body and ſoul, to behave your ſelves in
all things, to the glory of your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The laſt objection that I have met withall, is this, that
uſually in ſuch diſputes men rather ſeek themſelves then
the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and vent their paſſion, and
ſeek for maſtery rather then for truth: But I hope there
will be ſuch a preſence of the Spirit of Grace in the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
reſpondent, and my ſelf, that by our deportment we
ſhall be able to overthrow, and to detect the weakneſſe
of this objection; and therefore I deſire ye with ſilence,
and candor, to hear us whilſt we ſeek not our ſelves, but
the glory of God, in the exaltation of truth, in the name
of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I hope the people of God here gathered
together, will give me alſo the patient hearing of a word
or two, and ſo mete out the ſame meaſure unto me which
they have done to you. Whereas Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to inſtance in ſeverall places, wherein <hi>Paul</hi> the great
Apoſtle diſputed againſt the oppoſers of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
(which he ſtood up indeed to maintain againſt
the whole world) if you pleaſe, you may add to thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
another in the 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. where you ſhall find
that <hi>certain of the ſynagogue called the ſect of the Libertines
and Cyrenians diſputed againſt</hi> Stephen: So that ye ſee
there were diſputations as well managed againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
as by the Apoſtles; as well againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> as by
<hi>Paul,</hi> againſt thoſe that were enemies to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and that in the ſynagogues of the Jews.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:114759:18"/>
As for that which Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> was pleaſed to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
concerning the ſtate of the queſtion now in
diſpute, by which he doth diſtinguiſh it from thoſe
Queſtions or doubtfull Diſputations, whereunto the
weak Chriſtians were not to be admitted; I ſuppoſe
there is nothing ſpoken by <hi>Paul</hi> againſt their admiſſion
thereunto, but only this, that weak Chriſtians were not
to be intangled, or incombered, or denyed communion
in Church-fellowſhip, upon points or queſtions that
were doubtfull, and not clear but ambiguous, not but
that the weakeſt of all are fit, and indeed more fit to be
admitted to ſuch Diſputations which may tend to the
increaſe of their faith and knowledge, then other men:
But now whereas he chargeth ſo much weight upon the
queſtion now to be debated, through the aſſiſtance of
God, and his preſence with us, as that it is a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
point of Religion, and that which is of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to be believed by every man and woman unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
I muſt confeſſe, though I verily believe, that I
do place as much weight in it, and am as tender and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of the honor and glory of God (I may ſpeak it upon
this occaſion, though I be a fool for my labour, as <hi>Paul</hi>
ſomtimes ſaid, though upon another occaſion) as he can
do in that point oppoſite to mine, which he ſtands up
here to maintain; yet nevertheleſſe, I do not place any
ſuch weight or concernment in the queſtion, but that
whether men be of the one faith or of the other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be of his judgment, or of mine in the point,
they may be ſaved through the grace of God, which doth
not ſtand in this, that men ſhould take part evermore
with the right hand in matters of ſuch deep and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114759:19"/>
found conſideration as this is; but ſolely and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
in this, that they doe truly and ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation. Now whether it
be ſuppoſed, or held that Chriſt died for all men, or
onely for a certaine number of men, ſuch and ſuch, and
no other, this (I conceive) hath no influence at all,
but is altogether irrelative to the faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and that men may believe in Chriſt unto
ſalvation, whether they believe the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I deſire onely to add this one thing further to
the Congregation here preſent, I hope they are here
met together without prejudice in their judgements,
or at leaſt with their Conſciences unbyaſſed, (in a
point (I confeſſe) of very great concernment, though
not ſo great as hath been preſented to them) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I deſire to ſpeak theſe two things very briefly to them. Firſt
of all that for my ſelf, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in another caſe, he was a
long time a Pharifee, in the way of a Phariſee, and very ſtrict he
was, and did profit therein above many his equalls, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
when Chriſt was revealed to him, thoſe things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were a treaſure to him, which he highly eſteemed, and
thought himſelf in a happy condition becauſe of them, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he counted them but as droſſe and dung in compariſon
of the excellent knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt his Lord: So muſt I
profeſſe before you all this day (though in part it will redound
(it may be) to ſome ſhame, and diſparagement to my ſelf) yet
for the honour of him for whom I was created, and for whom
if I ſhould ſacrifice all that I have, or am, I am fully reſolved
herein that I cannot be better beſtowed, or diſpoſed of, then in
ſacrificing upon the ſervice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath
been already ſacrificed upon the ſervice of my ſoul, as of
yours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:114759:19"/>
Now this is that which I would ſignifie unto you, that for
my ſelf, for many yeares together, even ſince I was firſt capable
of underſtanding any thing in the Goſpell, and Miniſtry of God,
I was of that judgement whereof it ſeems Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> is at this
day, and though I would not ſpeak it of my ſelf, yet I crave
leave to acquaint you with what others have ſaid in this behalf,
that I ſpake more, and produced more Arguments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for the confirmation of that Opinion; more I ſay, then
what generally others of my Brethren in the Miniſtry, or others
of the ſame judgement with me then uſually did; But ſince it
pleaſed God to enlarge my underſtanding ſo far, as to go round
about the Controverſie, and to ſee, and ponder, and weigh,
(with the greateſt impartialneſs of Judgement, and Conſcience,
that I, with my weakneſſe and infirmities (common to all) was
capable of;) going I ſay round about, again and again, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the towers, and viewing the ſtrength, the arguments, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
and mighty demonſtrations of that Opinion and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein I now ſtand, I was not able, by all the help and
aſſiſtance that I had from all my former thoughts, and diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherein I had given out my ſelf to the utmoſt of that light,
and learning, and ſtrength which God had given me, all theſe
were of no value, or conſideration at all unto me, to ſtand up
againſt that further light which came in unto me on the other
hand, yea though I was conſcientiouſly, and deeply ingaged in
it; and this is one thing which I deſired to impart unto you upon
this occaſion.</p>
               <p>There is only one thing more, and then I have done: I know
it is the ſenſe of far the greateſt part of you, (if not of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality)
that in matters of Faith, and Religion, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
Salvation, (though but in ſuch a degree, as the preſent
queſtion doth, at a diſtance) that yet there is nothing, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
conſiderable to be built upon any mans reaſon, or upon
ſuch Diſcourſes, or Diſcuſſions, which are managed, or drawn
from the Scriptures by the interceding, or mediation of reaſon,
or humane underſtanding: which ſuppoſed, Let me ſay this unto
you, that there is no man who holds, that <hi>Chriſt Died for ſome
particular perſons, and not for all,</hi> but his Faith in this point doth
ſtand meerly, and purely upon the Diſcuſſion, Advice, and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114759:20"/>
of the reaſons of men; whereas that Opinion which I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
concerning the <hi>Vniverſality of Chriſts Death for all;</hi>
this ſtands upon expreſſe Scriptures, plaine and clear words,
and terms, without the intervention of any mans reaſon to carry
it, or to make it out; and therefore in as much as there is no
place in all the Scripture that doth affirme, that either <hi>Chriſt
Died for ſome particular perſons only;</hi> or that denies, that he
<hi>Died for all men,</hi> but many that expreſly and punctually in the
letter affirme, <hi>that he Died for all:</hi> therefore cleare it is (at leaſt
thus far) that all thoſe arguments which are brought from the
Scriptures to prove the contrary, they muſt be founded, and built
upon the Diſcuſſions, Iſſuings, and givings out of the reaſons, and
Apprehenſions of men.</p>

I ſhall only ſay this, and leave it with you, <hi>That Maſter</hi>

a word or two unto you: you informe this People with
as much diſparagement and uningenuity, as likely can be in ſo
many words, by telling them <hi>that I was not the first Man that
departed from the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt to an heterodox Faith,
and Opinion:</hi> wherein you certainely triumph before the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
and cry victoria before you put on your harneſſe; Poſſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concluding, that though <hi>I was not the firſt,</hi> yet I am in the
number and retinue of thoſe who have deſerted the Chriſtian
Faith, and turned in unto error; and I hope I may as freely ſay
this, that <hi>as you are not the firſt,</hi> ſo I hope <hi>you will not be the
laſt, who ſhall diſſert an Error, and Opinion, and wayes that are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114759:20"/>
not ſtreight, to turne into the wayes of Life and Peace;</hi> I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
profeſſe my hope and Chriſtian Belief concerning you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
then to cenſure, or determine any thing againſt you, as you
your ſelf have done againſt me: and for my part it is in vaine for

               <p>Sir, this is your Poſition (as I have received it
from the hand of Mr. <hi>Powel</hi>) which I intend, by the aſſiſtance
of the Lord, to oppoſe; <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt on Gods Part; and on
his own Part, in His Death, died intentionally to ſave all the
Poſterity of Adam.</hi> Is this the Poſition that you intend to
maintaine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>If it pleaſe you, there are no termes, in that tenor,
or forme, that doe much diſpleaſe me, but I had rather contract
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114759:21"/>
                  <hi>if it you will, and let it be thus,</hi> that Ieſus Chriſt Died intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
for all Men, or the Death of Christ was intended by God
for all Men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ames.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, there ſeemes (I humbly conceive) to be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for the putting in of ſome other words to the right ſtating
of this queſtion: thoſe who understand the great Controverſie
betweene the one, and the other, in this Point, call for ſome other
ſtating of it, as namely thus. Whether or no Ieſus Chriſt, in His
Death and Paſſion, did <hi>equally</hi> intend the Salvation of all the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
of the firſt Adam, one and other, without any difference;
pardon Me Sir herein, that I am put upon it to ſpeak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I conceive a pardon is only in caſe of offence,
and tranſgreſſion, but I know none that you have committed in
what you have now ſpoken; only I ſuppoſe that the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that word <hi>equally</hi> will not ſo much modell the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as multiply queſtions, and of one, it will beget many; for
to inquire, whether <hi>Chriſt Died equally for all,</hi> it ſeemes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
this, not only whether Chriſt, in the firſt and primary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of His Death, did intend the Salvation of all Men; but
whether, notwithſtanding any difference that ſhould ariſe in
Men, from themſelves, in the courſe of their Lives, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
afterwards, whether yet after any ſuch difference, as
for example after their Apoſtacy, or committing the ſin againſt
the Holy Ghoſt, that yet the Death of Chriſt was, or is then,
<hi>equally</hi> referrable, and relating to the Salvation of theſe Men,
as well as of any other; Now this (as I ſay) is a queſtion alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
excentricall to that queſtion which we are now come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to argue, and to conſider of.</p>

               <p>Mr. Moderator, if you pleaſe let that alone for it will
fall in of it ſelf. Sir, I prove then, <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt did not die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally
for all the posterity of Adam.</hi>

               <p>Firſt Argument, If Chriſt Died intentionally for
the Salvation of all the Posterity of Adam, then he Died as a
means of their Salvation; But he did not die as a meanes of their

Adam.</p>

your Minor: I ſhall have opportunity to diſtinguiſh it afterwards

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Symp.</speaker>
               <p>The Propoſition to be proved is this, That Jeſus
Chriſt did not die as a meanes for the Salvation of all Men; which
I prove thus, If He Died as a meanes of the ſalvation of all Men,
He Died as an effectuall or as an ineffectuall meanes; But Jeſus
Chriſt neither Died as an effectuall nor as an ineffectuall: And
therefore He did not die as a meanes at all.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing of your Minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
in one ſence He Died as a meanes <hi>effectuall,</hi> and in
another ſence not; He Died as a meanes <hi>effectuall</hi> thus, that there
was nothing more required on His Part, nor of Him that ſhould
performe, or undertake the office of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> or maker of
attonement for Man; ſo far the means, which Chriſt exhibited
in His Death, it was as <hi>effectuall</hi> as effectualneſſe it ſelf, or any
efficacy whatſoever could be: but if by <hi>effectuall</hi> you meane, ſuch
a means which doth <hi>take effect,</hi> that is, which doth end, and iſſue
in the ſalvation of all: ſo I affirme that Chriſt Died as a Means <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall.</hi>

               <p>I conceive that this anſwer of yours is no anſwer
at all to my argument: my reaſon is this, becauſe I look upon all
the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> not as Believers, or Unbelievers, but only
under that notion, and conſideration, as the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and ſo my argument is not yet anſwered: for if all the Poſterity
of <hi>Adam</hi> be lookt upon, Jeſus Chriſt did not die as an effectuall,
or ineffectuall means of their Salvation; and therefore your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
doth not reach my Argument in hand; anſwer therefore to
it, as the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> whether Chriſt Died for them, and
whether His Death was an effectuall, or an ineffectuall means of
their Salvation?</p>

intend, in that Anſwer which I have given, nor in any which I
ſhall give, to make anſwer to any thing that is in your concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
beneath, either on the one hand of your Argument, or on the
other, but take your Argument in that forme and tenor of words
wherein it was directed to me, and ſo I have cleerly anſwered
it: for your Propoſition was, that <hi>Christ Died neither as a means
effectuall, nor ineffectuall:</hi> and I have ſhewed how your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114759:22"/>
is invalid, and how, and in what ſence, he dyed as an <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
means,</hi> and how not: Now if you would take away my
Anſwer, you muſt prove, That Chriſt dyed in no ſence as a means
effectual, nor in any ſence as a means ineffectual, for the Salvation
of all men.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, the distinction (of the Respondent) is this,</hi> That
the Death of Chriſt is in a ſenſe effectual for the Salvation of all,
and in a ſenſe not. <hi>Now you are to anſwer to what part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
you pleaſe.</hi>

               <p>If the Death of the Lord Jeſus Christ be not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
for all, in any ſence, then your Anſwer is not good: But the
Death of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is not effectual for all, in any ſence:
<hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p>Sir, I deſire you plainly to ſhew me in what ſence it
is <hi>effectual;</hi> for it is a clear contradiction to ſay, that the ſame thing
ſhould be effectual, and ineffectual alſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>I have explained it in part, and ſhall be willing to do
it yet more fully: In this ſence therefore I ſay, that the Death of
Chriſt is <hi>effectual for all;</hi> that is, In caſe all men ſhall beleeve (as
I ſuppoſe they may, having means vouchſafed by God unto them
for that end,) there needs no more dying, nor attonement, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
for the Salvation of all theſe men, then that which Jeſus
Chriſt hath already exhibited and performed; but there is a vertue,
worth, ſubſtance, and what ever is requiſite in an attonement, or
ſacrifice, for the Salvation of all men. But now if you reſpect the
event, or iſſue of this Sacrifice, and Attonement; that is, Whether
all men come in time to be ſaved by it or no; in this ſence it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,</hi>
in point of event; but it is moſt <hi>effectual</hi> every way, in
reſpect of intrinſecal worth, and value. This is my clear ſence.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>I prove, That Chriſt did not dye as an effectual means
for all, or as a Sacrifice for all men, thus:</hi> If God did not intend to
give that to ſome, without which he certainly knew that it could
not be an effectual means to all, then Ieſus Chriſt did not dye as
an effectual means for all: But God did not intend to give that to
ſome, without which it could not be an effectual means to all; and
therefore, on Gods part, it was not an effectual means to all.</p>

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer briefly to the <hi>Major Propoſition,</hi> or indeed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114759:22"/>
to either, That the efficacy of the Death of Chriſt for all men, it
doth not at all depend, nor hath it any relation to any intention in
God otherwiſe; that is, either to give this or that to any man, or
unto all men, which ſhould make it <hi>de facto,</hi> or <hi>eventually effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
to all; but the efficacy of the Death of Chriſt is to be meaſured,
and judged of, by the intrinſecal and eſſential value and worth of
it, and not by any thing that God ſhould do, in any other Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of his, for, or towards, the Salvation of men.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>You give me no Anſwer to my Argument, which is,</hi>
That it is not an effectual means on Gods part, becauſe he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
not to give that, without which it could not be effectual.</p>

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>This I denyed, and gave you this reaſon for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Gods giving, or not giving, (though my Judgment is, that he
doth give ſufficient means to all to render the Death of Chriſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to them, though it is not neceſſary for me to declare my
Judgment in this point:) But this is ſufficient, as to the Anſwer
of your Argument, That the efficacy of the Death of Chriſt for
all is not ſuſpended, or doth not depend upon any Intention of
God, touching any other Diſpenſation to men, one, or more; but
before any ſuch Intention be conſiderable in him, the Death of
Chriſt is as <hi>efficacious,</hi> and as <hi>inefficacious,</hi> as ever it will be; the
nature, virtue, worth, and value of it doth not ſuffer any change,
either diminution, or augmentation, by any after-diſpenſation
whatſoever.</p>

neither is there any validity in what you ſay; for if what
you ſay be true, then there is a Contradiction in the Intentions of
God: For there is one Intention (ſay you) wherewith he intends
the Salvation of all men; and, according to my Argument, there is
another Intention, That he will not ſave all men: So that there
ſeems to be a Contradiction in the Intention of God.</p>

                  <hi>I humbly conceive, that you are come to the head of
this Argument, and that your ſence (Mr</hi> Goodwin) <hi>is this;</hi> That
the Death and Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt doth carry in it worth, and
merit, every way ſufficient for the Salvation of all thoſe that ſhall
by Faith, through Grace, lay hold upon it; and that there is alſo a
ſufficiency in it, even for thoſe who dye in their unbelief: <hi>And I

               <p>My Argument is not yet anſwered: I prove, That
there is not any ſuch Intention on Gods part; for then there ſhould
be contradictory Intentions in him, if, according to Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi>
Opinion, he intends the Salvation of all; and, according to that
which I prove, there is an Intention that he will not ſave all: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he will not give that to ſome, without which the Death of
Chriſt could not be effectual to them.</p>

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Sympſ.</speaker>
               <p>No; It is but a further progreſs in the Argument: I
prove, That God did not intend it as an effectual means, becauſe he
did not intend to do that, without which he knew it would not be
effectual: and if God did intend it as an effectual means, then there
is a Contradiction in Gods Intention.</p>

<hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p>I deny your <hi>Major Propoſition:</hi> It doth not follow
from hence, from Gods Intention <hi>that the Death of Chriſt ſhould
be Effectual for all,</hi> that therefore there ſhould be <hi>contradictory

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Sympſ.</speaker>
               <p>God intended that the Death of Chriſt ſhould not
be an Effectual means for the Salvation of ſome; and therefore if
he intended the Salvation of all by his Death, as a means, then there
are <hi>contradictory Intentions</hi> in the minde of God.</p>

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>To this, Anſwer hath been made before. The Law
of Contradictions, and contradictory Intentions, muſt relate <hi>ad
idem;</hi> it muſt be in reſpect of one and the ſame ſence, wherein
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114759:23"/>
both the Propoſitions, pretended to be contradictory, one to the
other, muſt be underſtood. As to the point in hand; We ſay, that
in one ſence God did intend the Death of Chriſt to be <hi>Effectual</hi> to
all; and in other ſence he intended it to be <hi>ineffectual:</hi> I gave you an
account of my diſtinction thus; In this ſence God did intend it an
<hi>Effectual</hi> means to all; that is, In caſe that all the World ſhould <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi>
there ſhould be a fountain, and pienty of Salvation for all men,
in it. But now in the other ſence, wherein I ſay, that God did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it as an <hi>Effectual</hi> means, my meaning is this, That he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that all men, nor any one man whatſoever, ſhould ever partake
of this ſatisfaction by the Death of Chriſt, but only by, and upon, his
beleeving. In this ſence, I ſay, God did intend that the Death of
Chriſt ſhould be <hi>ineffectual</hi> to all men, if Intentions may be nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in God, though I would not uſe that term; but I follow your
Argument, and I truſt to the capacity of all that hear me.</p>

<hi>You ſay,</hi> He intended it not as an <hi>Effectual</hi> means for thoſe
who ſhould not beleeve, but he did intend it as an <hi>Effectual</hi> means
to all thoſe who ſhould beleeve. <hi>This I apprehend is the ſubſtance

               <p>No, Sir; There is one thing wanting: For my
Anſwer imports, <hi>That even for thoſe who do not beleeve, the
Death of Chriſt is ſufficient</hi> (and that according to the Intention
of God) <hi>as well as for thoſe who do beleeve;</hi> elſe I ſhould not
maintain an agreement with my ſelf: But in this ſence I deny, that

ſhould not beleeve.</p>

               <p>No: I look upon the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> not as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,

or think, That God did ever intend to ſave all, or any man, actually,
by the Death of Chriſt, but upon, and by means of, his beleeving;
and at the ſame time, when he did intend the Salvation of all men,
he did intend likewiſe the Condemnation and periſhing of all thoſe
that ſhould dye in their unbelief: And theſe two Intentions have
no manner of repugnancy in God, but are as fair, and brotherly, and
as friendly, and will lodg together in the ſame infinite Love and
Grace, there being no manner of oppoſition, nor face of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,

               <p>I humbly conceive that the Disputation ſticks here,

of the Death of Chriſt:</hi> For in one ſence, Sir, you are
pleaſed to underſtand it <hi>Effectual to all,</hi> namely, <hi>ſo far onely as it
carries in it a ſufficiency;</hi> and in another, <hi>as it carries a certainty of
event,</hi> ſo you understand it <hi>ineffectual.</hi> Now we humbly intreat
you, becauſe theſe phraſes, or diſtinctions, of <hi>Effectualneſs</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectualneſs,</hi>
are not plainly underſtood, that therefore you would
pleaſe to explain your ſelf a little further, as to this.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I thought that I had explained my ſelf to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of moſt: My ſence is clearly this; When I ſay</hi> that God
did intend the Death of Chriſt to be <hi>Effectual</hi> unto all men, <hi>my
meaning is,</hi> That he did intend that it ſhould be of ſuch a nature,
tendency, worth, merit, and value, that there is no creature, nor
perſon, in all the world, man, or woman, but that they might be
ſaved by it; <hi>that is,</hi> In caſe they ſhould beleeve in Ieſus Chriſt,
they ſhould not ſuffer loſs of Salvation, for want of merit, attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or reconciliation, made with God for their ſins. <hi>In this ſence
I affirm it to be</hi> Effectual <hi>to all, and that according to the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God. But then, if by</hi> Effectual <hi>you mean this;</hi> That God
ſhould intend, that all men ſhould be actually ſaved, whether they
beleeve or no; <hi>that is,</hi> without all manner of conſideration, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114759:24"/>
the Death of Chriſt ſhould yet be <hi>Effectual</hi> to all; <hi>So I deny, that
God intended that it ſhould have any efficacy at all for any man, in
order unto his Salvation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now I do ſomewhat more fully underſtand your
meaning: You ſay,</hi> It is an effectual means in this ſence, becauſe
God doth intend, that whoſoever beleeves in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be
ſaved by his Death, as an effectual attonement. <hi>Now againſt this
Anſwer I form this Argument:</hi> If God did intend that ſome men
ſhould not beleeve, and did blinde others, when the Gospel was
preached unto them, that they ſhould not be able to ſee the truth of
it; the God did not intend that this ſhould be an effectual means
for the Salvation of all men, upon condition of beleeving: But
God did blinde ſome men, to whom the Gospel was preached, and
would not ſuffer them to behold this means; and therefore he did
not really intend the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, as an effectual means,
or as an attonement, for the Salvation of all men.</p>

               <p>I might here deny both the Propoſitions; and the
reaſon why I deny the <hi>major</hi> is this, becauſe God may upon the

not proceed from any originall intention of God in this reſpect,

But this decree was taken up by God before the Creature was

               <p>If you pleaſe to give me leave to anſwer, you may

I anſwer that the decree of God, <hi>not to give Faith</hi> to ſuch, or
ſuch men; or if you will to ſuch, and ſuch a ſort of men, ſo, and
ſo qualified; this decree of his, and ſo all his decrees whatſoever,
they are in Him (according to our uſuall expreſſion) from
eternity, and that without any reſpect at all had to man, they are
independant, and irriverſible. But if you come to matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of theſe His decrees, which is that we have under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
ſo God doth never intend the execution of any ſuch
Decree of His, as the actuall blinding of men, &amp;c. untill they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114759:26"/>
themſelves have contracted the moſt notorious and horrid guilt of
wilfull ſin, and diſobedience againſt Him; the decrees of God
concerning the Creature, before the Creature is in being, theſe are
in himſelf, abſolute, and peremptory, ſo that I ſuppoſe an abſolute
Decree in God from eternity; but the execution of this His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

               <p>If you pleaſe Sir, you wholy miſtake my Anſwer
in that, and are altogether beſide it; and how then is it poſſible
for you to argue to the edification of the People? My Anſwer
is not, that God Decreed from eternity to give or not to give to
any Particular Perſon the means of grace, or of believing; but
that his Decree is, not to give to ſuch a Species, or (if you will)
to ſuch a ſort, or kinde of Men; not to theſe Men or to thoſe
that prove in time to be of that ſort, and kinde, that is not my
meaning; but that God from eternity Decreed, that ſuch, and
ſuch a ſort of Men, who have advanced, and made long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
in wayes of ſin, and diſobedience, that theſe ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
of that capacity of believing, which was ſometime veſted
in them; As thus, to explaine my Anſwer, The Law of this
State, (or of any other) enacts the puniſhment of Death againſt
all kinde of Murtherers whatſoever, that ſhall be found in that
State; now this Law it doth not Decree, that this, or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
man by name, as <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>William,</hi> or the like, who in
time come to commit Murther, that this or that man ſhall be put
to death; but it doth as much decree, that the moſt innocent and
beſt deſerving men in all the State ſhall be put to death as well as
he that proves the Murtherer, in caſe they prove ſo alſo. And
this is my ſence concerning the Decrees of God. He decrees, that
ſuch, and ſuch men, who ſhall be rebellious to ſuch, and ſuch a
Degree, and period of wickedneſſe, that theſe ſhall be deprived
of the meanes of grace, and of believing: but this doth not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that ſuch or ſuch perſons, perſonally conſidered, who fall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114759:26"/>
under theſe Decrees of His, that they were any way Decreed, or
Determined by him to be denied the means of grace from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or to fall under this his Decree.</p>

the firſt is that, <hi>Iude 4. For there are certaine Men crept in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares,

to this ungodlineſſe here ſpoken of; then did God from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
intend that ſome Particular Perſons ſhould not believe: but
there were ſome ordained from eternity to this condemnation, not

               <p>I querie here two things: firſt whether God did
ordaine them from eternity to this condemnation: or, ſecondly,
if not, whether He ordained them to theſe ſins; one of theſe two
muſt needs be the meaning of this Scritpure.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>I have told you already in what ſenſe theſe Men
(and ſo all like to them,) were ordained of old unto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
(if by <hi>old</hi> you will underſtand <hi>eternity,</hi> which cannot be
proved to be the meaning of the word in this place, but rather
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114759:27"/>
it is to be underſtood (as ſome interpret it) of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.)
Yet if by old you underſtand eternity, it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from hence, that theſe Perſons perſonally conſidered, were
ordained to condemnation from eternity, that is together irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative.
I grant that God did Decree and Ordaine from eternity,
or of old that theſe Men, that is ſuch as theſe were, and ſo theſe
Perſons too in a conſequentiall way, they were ordained to
this condemnation by God; but its cleare from this Scripture
that the reaſon, or that which makes them to fall under this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of His, it is their ungodlineſſe, or turning the grace of
God into laciviouſneſſe. Now if you can prove that God did
ordaine of old, that theſe Men by name <hi>ſhould be ungodly, and
ſhould turne the grace of God into laciviouſneſſe;</hi> then, and not till

was paſt with God, and ſtated, and eſtabliſhed in himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any thing was in being, as touching the godlineſſe, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe
of men; but this is that which I ſay that the tenor,
and import of this Decree of His was this, that not any Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
men, no not theſe more then others, ſhould be ordained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
but that theſe, or whoſoever elſe ſhould fall into the

whereas you was pleaſed, even now to aſſert the eternall Decrees
of God concerning the Creature before the foundation of the World
was laid, and now ſeeme to hint a difference even in thoſe eternall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114759:27"/>
Decrees; I humbly requeſt to know your judgement whether, or

               <p>Your queſtion is very faire, and pertinent, and
may help to give a further light into the buſineſſe in hand; and
therefore my Anſwer to it is this, I conceive that thoſe Decrees
of God from eternity, they doe ſuppoſe a poſſibility of ſuch
ſtates and conditions of men in time to be, or that there will be
ſuch and ſuch a generation of men as thoſe Decrees do ſuppoſe,
and lay out; but they doe not ſuppoſe any abſolute neceſſity of
ſuch, and ſuch men, of ſuch and ſuch qualities, or qualifications to
be: and this is my ſence touching your queſtion.</p>

               <p>Sir, I humbly crave leave to aske another queſtion,
and to reply thus far, that if ſo be theſe Decrees of God which
even now you were pleaſed to grant were peremptory, abſolute, and
irreverſible, are now ſuppoſſitive of a state and condition of the
Creature, theſe two Aſſertions doe not ſeeme, I humbly conceive,
to conſist together; if they were abſolute in God (as you was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to declare) from eternity, and yet have an eye upon the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſorts or kinds of Men, that one part of them is hypotheticall, and
ſuppoſitive of ſuch or ſuch a ſtate.</p>

               <p>No Sir, if you underſtood me ſo, then there was
ſo much miſtake in my Anſwer my ſence is this, and I would
have both my ſence, and meaning, and minde, and judgement in
theſe queſtions drawn out to the utmoſt, and as far as I have any
thought, or peace of a thought in me, I deſire not to canceale, or
hide any thing from the view or cogniſcence of any, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I accompt my ſelf really and in good earneſt, beholding to
any man, that ſhall adminiſter an occaſion, or give me an oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to expreſſe, and hold forth to the utmoſt, what God hath
inabled me to conceive in them. And therefore for that whereas
there may ſeeme to be an inconſiſtency between theſe two Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters
(as you ſeeme to conceive) <hi>that the Decrees of God ſhould
be abſolute and independent, upon the Creature;</hi> and yet that they
ſhould be <hi>relative to ſuch, and ſuch a ſtate or condition of Men:</hi>
I conceive that there is no manner, no nor ſcarce ſo much as the

not by any thing in man, nor by any thing done by man, no nor
from the nature of ſin it ſelfe, but this flowes meerly from his
pure, abſolute, and intire Will, together with the infinite purity,
and holineſſe of his Nature, and of His Wiſdom, for they are all
ſummoned together in all His Decrees, there is an ingrediency
and concurrence of all the great and glorious Perfections of
God: and theſe Decrees I ſay are taken up by Him without any

               <p>I humbly crave leave once more to reply; you are
pleaſed to declare theſe Decrees of God to be originally in Himſelf,
without any extrinſicall motive perſwading him hereunto, Sir, do
you ſpeak (I beſeech you) of thoſe two ſorts of Men, which theſe
Decrees do finde in different ſtates in the World, or doe you ſpeake
only of that Decree which terminates it ſelf only in one of theſe ſorts
or kindes of Men, which it meets withall here.</p>

               <p>Sir, I do by the Decrees of God (in the notion
wherein I expreſſe myſelf) intend all, and all manner of Decrees,
which have any relation to the Creature, under what poſſible
condition ſoever included in them: as if you will name any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
you ſhall finde ſuch, and ſuch a kinde of Creature menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
and included in it: and I underſtand the Decrees of God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114759:28"/>
univerſally, all ſuch as have any reſpect to the Creature, or to any
ſtate of the Creature, and <hi>I</hi> conceive that all the Decrees of God
whatſoever (<hi>I</hi> ſpeak a great deale of my ſence at once in this)
reſpect ſorts and kinds of mens perſons under ſuch, and ſuch a
qualification, and that none of them reſpect any Particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <p>This is you Anſwer, <hi>that the eternall Decrees of
God doe reſpect certaine ſorts of Men and not Particular Perſons
amongſt Men:</hi> But the Decrees of God do reſpect ſome Particular
Perſons amongſt men, and not ſo much ſome ſorts and kinds of
men, and therefore this Anſwer of yours is not ſufficient to my
Argument.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> prove it from, <hi>Rom. 9. 11. For the children being
not yet borne, neither having done any good or evill, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of God according to election might ſtand not of workes; but of
him that calleth it was ſaid unto her,</hi> Jacob <hi>have I loved but</hi>
Eſau <hi>have I hated;</hi> Here it is plaine that Gods Decree doth reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Particular Perſons, to wit <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and therefore
it doth not reſpect ſome ſorts of men: its cleer <hi>I</hi> ſay from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and likewiſe from that concerning <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the latter
part of this Chapter.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>To your Argument <hi>I</hi> anſwer thus that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be proved from hence for your purpoſe: neither doth
any thing appeare to make out any ſuch concluſion, for firſt of
all whereas you render the words thus, <hi>for the children being not
yet borne</hi> you will finde (if you looke) that there is no ſuch
word as <hi>Children</hi> in the Originall, and you may eaſily perceive
it in the Tranſlation, it being inſerted in a different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
and though <hi>I</hi> have many things to ſay concerning this
place, yet <hi>I</hi> deſire that this firſt may be taken notice of, that
thoſe whom the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, they were not ſo much
the Perſons of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> as the Poſterity of both, and this
is moſt cleer and evident in that Parallel place of Scripture from
whence this is cited, which is <hi>Geneſ. 25. 22, 23. And the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
(ſaith the ſtory of <hi>Moſes) strugled together within her, and
ſhee ſaid if it be ſo why was I thus, and ſhee went to inquire of
the Lord. And the Lord ſaid unto her,</hi> (marke, here was the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114759:29"/>
Divine oracle which the Apoſtle relates) <hi>two Nations are in
thy womb, and two manner of People ſhall be ſeparated from thy
bowells, and the one People ſhall be stronger then the other People,
and the elder ſhall ſerve the yonger.</hi> Therefore it is plaine that
there is no manner of Decree, nor nothing ſpoken of the perſons
of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> perſonally conſidered, but only concerning
their poſterity.</p>
               <p>Againe ſecondly, <hi>I</hi> anſwer Further (<hi>which I deſire may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
noted, for I ſuppoſe that a cleere underſtanding of this
place will open a great light to the queſtion now in hand</hi>) if you
will pleaſe therefore to take the ſpring of the firſt riſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
arguing in this paſſage of Scripture, you muſt begin at
the ſixth Verſe: And you will cleerly ſee that the Apoſtle had
nothing to do, it was no part of his ſcope to argue the point of
<hi>election from eternity,</hi> but that which he had to doe it was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
and to give further confirmation to the Doctrine of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by Faith, which he had ſet on foot, and mannaged all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
this Epiſtle to this very place; for the Apoſtle Writing his
Epiſtle chiefly to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he doth declare unto them how
that God Himſelf did Preach this very Doctrine unto their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fathers,
the great Patriarks, and Founders of their Nation, and
People, and that firſt unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and
his Family as if you mind the carriage of the place you wil cleerly
ſee in the ſixth Verſe, <hi>not as if the Word of God had taken none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
for they are not all Iſrael which are of Iſrael.</hi> He doth here
anticipate an Objection which the <hi>Iews,</hi> would be ready to make
againſt the Doctrine of Juſtification which he had handled, and
Preached to them.</p>

here you Preach a Sermon, but give me a ſhort Anſwer to my
Argument, that ſo <hi>I</hi> may reply, <hi>My Argument is, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of God doe reſpect Particular Perſons,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> prove this from
<hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and in ſtead of giving an Anſwer to it you fall

               <p>I humbly intreat leave to deſire, that you would pleaſe to
contract your Anſwer to the 11, and 12. Verſes, which M. <hi>Sympſon</hi>

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>If the 11, and 12. Verſes cannot be underſtood, nor
an account given of them, without ſhewing the ſcope, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
and Coherence of the place, then, if I be long, and you finde
fault, you do not reflect ſo much upon me, as upon the Word of
God it ſelf, which is ſo myſterious and deep, and ſo remote from
the common apprehenſions of men, that it cannot be underſtood o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.
But I ſhall undertake (upon the opening and clearing of
the Apoſtles minde in the Context) to ſhew, that your Argument
from this place is altogether irrelative to your purpoſe.</p>

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Ames.</speaker>
               <p>I humbly conceive that the 11. Verſe may readily
receive an Anſwer from you, without reference to the fore-going
Verſes, and that according to the reading which you were pleaſed
to give us out of the Greek, namely, <hi>That there is no mention
made there of Children,</hi> as you learnedly obſerved: And I humbly
conceive it lies as a Foundation of that Conſequence which the
Apoſtle brings in the 11. Verſe; which 11. Verſe is a general rule
concerning <hi>Election,</hi> and the Purpoſe of God, <hi>The children being
not yet born, that the Purpoſe of God according to Election might
ſtand,</hi> and that without any reference to the Works of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I humbly conceive that this is the Foundation which the
Apoſtle layeth in the 11. Verſe, without any relation to his former
Diſcourſe, unleſs it be to ground it upon.</p>

               <p>If you pleaſe to minde the words, you will ſee that
the whole Verſe is inſerted in a Parentheſis, and it lieth within the
body of a Context, or Coherence, which cannot be clearly and
fully underſtood, without the opening of what went before.</p>

               <p>I humbly intreat one word more; Whereas you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

               <p>If you pleaſe to minde the firſt particular in the 11.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114759:30"/>
Verſe [<hi>For</hi>] which is a Rationative Particle, it doth lead us, as it
were, by the hand, and carries us back to what went before; and
there is a Reaſon given in it of ſomewhat which the Apoſtle had
before aſſerted.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I humbly conceive the Parentheſis begins at theſe
words,</hi> That the Purpoſe of God according to Election might ſtand,
not of Works, but of him that calleth; <hi>and that the other hath
reference to the former diſcourſe.</hi>

               <p>Then, if you pleaſe, we will onely go to the Verſe
immediately before; for I ſuppoſe that this preſent diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, and diſcuſſion of this buſineſs, the main intent and drift
of it is not, that you or I be pleaſed, but that the Congregation
and People of God be edified; and therefore whatſoever doth, in
a clear and direct way, tend to their edification, that I conceive
ought not to be denyed, either by me, in reference to you, not by
you, in reference unto me; and the opening of this Scripture may,
I conceive, tend much that way.</p>

               <p>This was my Argument, <hi>That the Decrees of God

this place, where <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are ſpoken of, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
afterwards; and therefore the Decrees of God do reſpect particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
perſons, and not men of ſuch and ſuch a ſort, as you ſay:
though, if you pleaſe, that we may not be weariſom to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
we will let that of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> alone, and go to

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>I have ſhewed you before, That all Gods Decrees
they are precedaneous to any Creature, before it was in being; for
God hath no temporary Decrees, ſuch as are taken up in time: this
was abſolutely denyed before. But this is that which I ſay, That if
you will underſtand the place of the perſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> (for
in the proceſs of the diſcourſe I would have granted you that,
though it be more then the place will afford, and that place in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi>
is directly contrary to it, for it is ſpoken of two Nations, <hi>Two
Nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people ſhall be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114759:30"/>
from thy bowels;</hi>) yet whether you reſpect the two Nations,
or the two Heads of theſe Nations, to wit, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> the
Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of them here, either under any conſideration
or relation to their perſons, nor ſimply to their poſterity; but he
ſpeaks of them, as of Types and Figures of Gods different Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
whereby he did declare, and teach the Nation of the Jews,
both in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, in the caſe of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and in
<hi>Iſaac's</hi> Family, in the caſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> the Doctrine of
Juſtification by Faith, which was the great Doctrine diſputed and
depending between him and the Jews: And if you minde the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
you will ſee that he argues very plainly and evidently;
<hi>They are not all Iſrael</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which are of Iſrael: neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are the ſeed of Abraham, are they all children:</hi> that is,
They are not all heirs of Heaven that are the natural ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.
But in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called:</hi> that is, Thoſe ſhall
be counted for the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who ſhall inherit, that ſhall
be begotten and born, after the manner of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which was by
Promiſe, for ſo he was born by force and virtue of a Promiſe, which
was this, <hi>At this time will I come, and Sarah ſhall have a ſon:</hi> and
therefore, ſaith he, God did intend by this to ſhew, that thoſe only
ſhould be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who ſhould inherit, (<hi>atexikin</hi>)
that ſhould be born, not of the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Bondwoman,</hi> but of the
<hi>Promiſe,</hi> which was made to the World in Jeſus Chriſt; and this
was ſignified in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, in <hi>Iſmael</hi> the ſon of the <hi>Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,</hi>
and in <hi>Iſaac</hi> the ſon of the <hi>Free-woman. And not onely
ſo,</hi> (mark it,) <hi>but when Rebecca alſo had conceived by one, even
by our father Iſaac, before the children were born, or had done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good or evil, It was ſaid unto her, The elder ſhould ſerve the
younger:</hi> As if he had ſaid, God did not onely teach this Doctrine
of Juſtification by Faith, in oppoſition to Juſtification by the
Works of the Law, in the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the one being a childe of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and the
other a ſon of the <hi>Bond-woman.</hi> But much more did he teach it in
the Family of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in the caſe, and under the types, of <hi>Rebecca's</hi>
two ſons, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> and the meaning of this phraſe [<hi>And
not onely this</hi>] is clearly this, Whereas the Jews might finde ſome
exception againſt that inſtance which <hi>Paul</hi> had brought in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Family, to wit, the example of <hi>Iſmael; It's true</hi> (might
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114759:31"/>
the ſay) <hi>he was rejected by God, and look'd upon as a ſtranger,
and</hi> Iſaac <hi>he was made the Heir, but it was becauſe</hi> Iſmael <hi>was a
rough fellow, and an ungracious ſon, and the like: But</hi> Iſaac <hi>he
was a Darling Childe.</hi> Now becauſe the Jews were ready thus to
object againſt that, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> comes upon them, and backs
his former Argument, with another inſtance, againſt which there
lay no exception in the leaſt: <hi>And not onely this,</hi> which is, as if he
had ſaid thus; I know you will be apt to quarrel againſt what I
now ſay, but I will produce you another inſtance, againſt which
you ſhall have nothing to ſay: It's true, <hi>Iſmael</hi> he was the ſon
of <hi>Hagar</hi> the <hi>Bond-woman,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> he was the ſon of the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman;</hi>
and therefore you will be ready to ſay, there was great
reaſon why <hi>Iſmael</hi> ſhould be rejected for coming of the <hi>Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,</hi>
he had no right to the inheritance; but <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who came
of the <hi>Free-woman,</hi> he had. But now (ſaith the Apoſtle) I will
bring you another inſtance, againſt which you ſhall have no ſuch
thing to object, and that is of <hi>Rebecca, She alſo conceived by one,
even by our father Iſaac:</hi> Now ye cannot ſay, that <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
were born the one of the <hi>free-woman,</hi> and the other of the
<hi>bond,</hi> and yet <hi>before they were born, that the Purpoſe of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
It was ſaid unto her, The Elder, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning clearly is
this; <hi>That the Purpoſe of God according to Election might ſtand:</hi>
that is, That the Decree or Purpoſe of God, concerning thoſe
whom he would elect unto Life and Salvation, and make choyce of
to inherit, that this Purpoſe of his might ſtand; that is, That it
might appear to ſtand, and be declared to be firm, unalterable, and
unchangeable: Therefore he brings in the caſe of the two ſons of
<hi>Iſaac, Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob; Before they were yet born, or had done
good or evil:</hi> The Apoſtle brings in this by way of Anſwer to that
Objection which the Jews might make, which is, as if he ſhould
ſay, You cannot ſay here, that the one of theſe was an ungracious
ſon, and the other toward, and gracious; but <hi>before they were
born, or had done good or evil, it was ſaid,</hi> (this was the Oracle
from Heaven) that <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger:</hi> that is, That
Juſtification by Faith (the younger Brother,) that is, the latter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
the new Way, or Covenant of Life, which God had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
with the World, this ſhould have the preheminency, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114759:31"/>
take place; and [the elder Brother] that is, the old way of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Works, this ſhould be ſervile to it: Of which two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
<hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were Types.</p>

               <p>Sir, I have onely one word humbly to preſent unto
you, after this large Expoſition of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. which is, to intreat
your ſence in this, Whether the Holy Ghoſt, in this place, where
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> quoted out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> making this
Particular ſerviceable to the ancient Decree, That <hi>the elder
ſhould ſerve the younger,</hi> founded upon that eternal Maxim, <hi>That
the Decree of God according to Election ſhould ſtand;</hi> Whether
this diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, bringing down this ancient Decree
through ſeveral Families, and ſhewing it in the perſons of <hi>Jacob</hi>
and <hi>Eſau,</hi> doth not demonſtrate, That the Decrees of God do take
particular notice, and are determined upon particular perſons.</p>

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Goodw.</speaker>

               <p>
                  <hi>Yes, under a particular conſideration; and my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is this:</hi> If the Decrees of God do respect <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
then they respect particular perſons: But here is a Decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
and Reprobation, which doth respect the perſons of <hi>Jacob</hi>
and <hi>Eſau.</hi> Ergo.</p>

               <p>If you had put your Argument into ſuch terms, that
my former Anſwer needed not to have been repeated, I would
have ſaid ſomething to it; but this hath been anſwered before:
He doth not ſay here in theſe words, <hi>that the purpoſe of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Election might ſtand,</hi> concerning <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or particularly; but that <hi>Purpoſe of God according to Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
whereof he here ſpeaks, reſpects univerſally the whole World.
And the reaſon why <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are here mentioned, and ſo
the reaſon of what was ſaid to the Mother of them, when ſhe
was big with them, it was by way of confirmation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of God from Eternity touching the whole world: For it's
clear, <hi>The children being not yet born, neither having done any
good or evil, that the Purpoſe of God according to Election might
ſtand:</hi> He doth not ſay, That any Decree of Election, or Purpoſe
of God about Election, in reference to <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> might
ſtand.</p>

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Sympſ.</speaker>
               <p>It's plain, in reference to <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> perſonally,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114759:32"/>
as he proves it, <hi>Eſau have I hated, and Jacob have I loved.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>That is nothing elſe but an Explication from the
Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> of the former Oracle of God, concerning theſe
two children, as they were Heads of the Nations; and it doth no
way prove, that the Decree here of Election did reſpect their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſons, perſonally conſidered, no nor that they did reſpect
their poſterity, but onely that theſe perſons, and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
were ſo ordered and diſpoſed of by God, that they
ſhould ſerve, as it were, by way of Doctrinal Type and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to the <hi>WORLD,</hi> how, and upon what terms,
and under what Covenant, GOD would juſtifie and ſave
them.</p>

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Ames.</speaker>
               <p>Mr <hi>Sympſon,</hi> If you pleaſe to diſcourſe from the
11, and 12. Verſes, and ſhew by a neceſſary Conſequence, <hi>That
Gods Purpoſe and Decree doth mind from Eternity particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
then ſhall you directly oppoſe the Anſwer which the learned
Opponent hath given.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr</hi> Sympſ.</speaker>
               <p>For that, I have plainly held it forth, and my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not yet anſwered: I ſay, that <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſons, and that the Decree of God reſpected them, and
that before they had done either good or evil; That he loved the
one before he had done any good, and hated the other before he
had done any evil; and therefore the Decrees of God do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
ſorts or kindes of men, but particular perſons: And that
there are a particular number of men, whom God did love
from Eternity, not from any fore-ſeen Faith or Works in
them; And that there are a particular number of men, who
are reprobated from Eternity, not in conſideration of any ſin or
unbelief found in them. This is that which I hold out, even
an Eternal Decree of God concerning the Salvation of particular
perſons, not in conſideration of Faith or Holineſs in them, but
meerly from his own Love, or <hi>Bené placitum,</hi> that being the
ground of his Election: God doth not chooſe men becauſe
he fore-ſees that they will be holy; but he doth therefore
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114759:32"/>
chooſe them, that they may be holy, as the Apoſtle doth plainly
make it out to us in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4, 5. where it is ſaid, That <hi>we are
elected in Chriſt Jeſus, that we might be holy:</hi> So that no holineſs
or faith, or any thing in the creature, is the ground of electing of any
perſon, but only the Will of God, <hi>Who works all things</hi> (ſaith the
Apoſtle) <hi>according to the counſel of his own Will;</hi> and therefore
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth,
that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt
revealed them unto Babes:</hi> and when he had done ſo, he layeth
down no other reaſon but this, <hi>Even ſo, O Father, becauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thee.</hi> And ſo likewiſe the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. in that golden
Chain of <hi>Calling,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>Glorification,</hi> he doth not
make them <hi>Antecedents</hi> to Election, (as they who hold Univerſal
Redemption do,) but <hi>Conſequences</hi> of Election; and this is the
point which I deſire liberty to prove, namely, That there are ſome
particular perſons hated of God from all eternity, and that there
are others loved of God from eternity; and that God did really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Salvation of the one by the Death of Chriſt, and not in
good erneſt the Salvation of the other, but rather the aggravation
of their condemnation thereby.</p>

thoſe three Verſes in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11, 12, 13. from whence it hath been

in this, That the Decrees of God from eternity do reſpect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of men, only one faſtens it upon the ſtate, and the other upon
the perſon; and therefore, if it pleaſe you, I deſire that they may
be recalled to what they have ſaid: And concerning this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo far as it concerns this Diſpute, that they would only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,

thoſe words; <hi>That the purpoſe of God according to election
might ſtand:</hi> they contain that great Declaration of the abſolute
purpoſe of God, by which, and according to the tenor of which

               </speaker>
               <p>For that we muſt refer it to the wiſdom which
God hath given to his ſervants to judge, Whether Election be of
particular perſons, or of ſtates and conditions. It is the deſire
of the Moderator that I addreſſe my ſelf to a new Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your Poſition, which I do; <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt did not dye
intentionally on his Fathers part, for all the poſterity of Adam.</hi>
My Argument is this. Chriſt did not dye to ſave thoſe whom
his Father had actually damned before he ſuffered; But there
were ſome that were actually damned before Jeſus Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
death, and therefore God the Father in the death of his ſon
did not intend the Salvation of all men.</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I abſolutely deny your Major Propoſition, for
it holds as effectually againſt thoſe who dyed in the Faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, as thoſe who dyed in their unbeleef, if the death of
Chriſt onely wrought forward.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr <hi>Simpſon.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I prove the Propoſition, that God did not intend
the Salvation of thoſe who were damned, before the death of
Chriſt, thus: It is an unreaſonable thing for a man to intend
the Salvation of him whom he knows certainly is already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and we cannot think the true God to be ſo irrational as to
intend the Salvation of thoſe whom he certainly knew were
actually condemned by himſelf before.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr <hi>Simpſon.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Then let us have it, and not a diſcourſe of halfe

                  <hi>Mr</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>It is every whit as irrationall, that Chriſt ſhould
dye, to ſave thoſe who were already actually ſaved, as it is to ſay
that he ſhould dye to ſave thoſe who were already actually dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But I deny your Major Propoſition, and ſay, That the
death of Chriſt is conſiderable two wayes, either firſt in reſpect
of the efficacy of it, and the intention of God in it, or ſecondly, in
reſpect of the execution of it. In reſpect of the firſt, Chriſt dyed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114759:33"/>
as much from the beginning of the World, (at leaſt upon the
fall of <hi>Adam</hi>) as he did at that very houre when he was actually
Crucified. And for the latter, thoſe who were damned before
the litterall Crucifying of Chriſt, yet they were not damned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch a Crucifying of Him, as was effectuall to haved ſaved
them.</p>

               <p>If God had actually damned ſome men before the

               <p>I anſwer by denying your major propoſition with
this diſtinction, that there were no men damned before the death
of Chriſt in ſuch a ſence, and ſo conſidered as it was effectuall to
have ſaved them, and my reaſon is cleerly this: becauſe the death
of Chriſt from the foundation of the World, was as effectuall to
have ſaved them, as it is to ſave thoſe that ſhould believe after the
litterall and actuall performance of it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Simp.</hi> You are to prove that thoſe who were in
a ſtate of condemnation, and perdition and damned in Hell, before
the actuall ſufferings of Chriſt had not a ſufficient proviſion for
Salvation, upon the accompt of the Death of Chriſt whileſt they
lived. You muſt prove that there was not a ſufficiency in the Death
of Chriſt, for the ſaving of them before the litterall execution of it,
or His actuall ſuffering upon the Croſſe: and that there was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
in God for their ſalvation by His Death, who were damned
before he came into the World.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I prove it thus. If God had no intention to give
Faith unto them, then he had no intention to ſave them by the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114759:34"/>
Death of Chriſt; But God had no intention to give Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, therefore He had no intention to ſave them by His
Death.</p>

               <p>I diſtinguiſh firſt that Phraſe of yours of giving
Faith unto them, if by giving Faith you mean that God ſhould
give it to them, by an irreſiſtible hand, or upon any ſuch termes
as that they could not but receive it: ſo I deny your major Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
if by giving Faith you meane (that which the Scripture
doth, in that Phraſe which is) the giving men Faith in the means
of it, that is ſuch means which are proper and ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and worke it; in this ſence I affirme that God did give Faith
unto theſe men, that is, He gave ſufficient means to them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to have believed, and ſo to have been ſaved by the Death of
Chriſt.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I prove that God did not give them ſufficient means
in this ſence. If God did not give them the knowledge of the
Goſpell in any meaſure, then he did not give them ſufficient
means of believing, but God did not give them the knowledge of
the Goſpell in any meaſure, <hi>ergo.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>I deny both Propoſitions, for though God did not
give them the knowledge of the Goſpell, yet i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> have gave them
means and opportunities, whereby to come to the knowledge of
the Goſpell, then he gave them ſufficient means to believe. And
then againe I deny the minor (for they are both tardy) that
God did not give them the knowledge of the Goſpell in any
meaſure.</p>

               <p>If God did ſuffer them to walk in their own blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and darkneſſe, then he did to give them means for the
knowledge of the Goſpell; But God did ſuffer them, to walke
in their own blindneſſe and darkneſſe, therefore he did not give
them ſufficient means for the knowledge of the Goſpell. I prove
it from <hi>Acts 14. 16. who in times paſt ſuffered all Nations to walk
in their own wayes.</hi> From whence my Argument is this, if God
ſuffered all Nations to walke in their own wayes, then he did not
give to all Nations a ſufficiency of means for the knowledge of
the goſpell: But God ſuffered all Nations to walke in their own
wayes, <hi>ergo.</hi>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114759:34"/>
words immediately following doe confute it, <hi>nevertheleſſe he left
not Himſelf without witneſſe, in that he did good and gave us raine
from Heaven, and fruitfull Seaſons, filling our hearts with food
and giadneſſe.</hi> Which clearly ſhewes, that though God did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all Nations to walke in their own wayes, yet nevertheleſſe
he gave them ſufficient means whereby to have known Him,
and His grace and goodneſſe to the World in Jeſus Chriſt. This
I ſay is cleerly proved in that Verſe, for although He ſuffered
theſe Nations to walke in their own wayes, that is, did not deal
with them as with men under the Goſpell, yet he did give them
ſo much means to have reſtrained and reduced them from their
owne wayes as had they been vigilant, and attentive would
have been ſufficient to have recovered themſelves out of
them.</p>

               <p>I prove it thus, if the giving of Raine and fruitfull

then your interpretation of the words is not ſufficient to
my Argument. <hi>But the giving of Raine and fruitfull Seaſons is
not a ſufficient means for the knowledge of the Goſpell, ergo.</hi> That
which the Heathen had was only this witneſſe from God, that
he gave them Raine and fruitfull Seaſons, and this is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

               <p>I anſwer, that to give Raine from Heaven and
fruitfull Seaſons, filling mens hearts with food and gladneſſe
are ſufficient to bring men to the knowledge of the Goſpell, and
I give my accompt hereof from the words briefly thus, becauſe
it is ſaid, <hi>That God left not Himſelf without Witneſſe:</hi> now the
Nature and Property of all Witneſſes (eſpecially on Gods part)
it is to ſpeak intelligibly and to utter their voice and teſtimony,
in ſuch a Language that they whom it concerne to hear, and
are preſent may underſtand and perceive; Now the Witneſſe
which God did not leave himſelf here without, it was the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of His goodneſſe to the World, which was by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> underſtand your Anſwer and Reply: if the Word
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114759:35"/>
Preached be the only ſufficient means for the working of Faith,
then men have not a ſufficiency of means for believing who only
have Raine and fruitfull Seaſons: But the Word Preached is
the only ſufficient means to work Faith in men; and therefore
Raine and fruitfull Seaſons are not ſufficient. I prove the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
Propoſition from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Faith comes by hearing
and hearing by the Word of God Preached,</hi> but Raine and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Seaſons cannot Preach the Word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>You might have ſpared your Proof till it had been
denyed. But <hi>I</hi> anſwer by diſtinguiſhing of that tearme ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
and ſufficient means, if by <hi>ſufficient</hi> means you meane
ſuch a means ſo abundant (as it were,) that men may with the
more facility and eaſe attaine believing, ſo <hi>I</hi> grant (in this ſence)
that the Preaching of the goſpell is the only <hi>ſufficient</hi> means of
believing, but if you meane by a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of means, ſuch a
means without which it is impoſſible that any man ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
So <hi>I</hi> deny that the Preaching of the goſpell (that is, in
that ſence wherein <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe you meane) a verball Preaching of
it by men, and that this is the only ſufficient means to worke
Faith in men, and the Apoſtle in that Scripture ſpeaks of ſuch
a Preaching of the goſpell, which is by the <hi>Sun, Moone</hi> and

                  <hi>I</hi> would have the Congregation to take notice, and

Faith in men.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114759:35"/>
goſpell, we will not be ſo injurious as to preſſe you above your
bodily ſtrength, my Argument is this, <hi>if the Preaching of the
Gospell be the only ſufficient means received for the making known
of the meanes of grace, then Raigne and fruitfull Seaſons are not
ſufficient: But the Preaching of the Gospell is the only ſufficient
means required for the making known of the meanes of grace, and
therefore Raine and fruitfull Seaſons are not ſufficient:</hi> I meane
Preaching of the goſpell is the only externall meanes, I know the
Preaching of the ſpirit is neceſſary beſides it.</p>

               <p>By the way Sir, give me leave to Anſwer a word
to that by expreſſion of yours, (<hi>externall means,</hi> &amp;c.) if ſo be
that your ſence be (as you have partly declared) concerning
the inward means of believing, that Faith is wrought by an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable
hand and power of God, then I ſay all outward means
whatſoever, they are irrellative, and have nothing at all to doe
in the work of Faith: But to your Argument I anſwer, That if
by <hi>the Preaching of the Goſpell</hi> you meane a verball Preaching
of it by men, then I ſay it is not the only outward means which
God is pleaſed to uſe to work Faith in men, or to bring them
to believe, but if you meane by the preaching of it, a preaching
of it at large, or in any way; So I grant that the preaching of
the goſpell is the only abſolute neceſſary, and ſufficient means to
bring men to believe, but then this I add, that <hi>raine and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Seaſons, and filling mens hearts with food and gladneſſe,</hi>
theſe do preach the goſpell though not ſo cleerly, punctually,
and diſtinctly, yet as truly, as words or as a verball peraching
doth amount unto.</p>

of all theſe particularities of the Death of Chriſt, and I give
this reaſon and accompt of this my anſwer, becauſe it cannot
be proved (but the contrary) that the <hi>Jewes</hi> generaly, even

leaving Himſelf without witneſſe,</hi> there the Apoſtle speakes of
the naturall capacity of Man, and of that naturall light, which
is in him by which he is able to collect a Deity who is to be feared,
reverenced and obeyed; And beyond this ſame naturall light and
knowledge of a Deity, we are not able to conceive how the Son,
Moon, Raine, and fruitfull Seaſons ſpeak any thing concerning
the mediatorſhip of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>To give a faire Anſwer to a faire Demand, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
queſtion, <hi>I</hi> ſhall willingly doe it, my ſence therefore
cleerly is this: <hi>That the witneſſe of Himſelf which God is there
ſaid not to have left Himſelf without</hi> by the meanes there expreſt
it muſt be not only a witneſſe of his Godhead, as of his power
and wiſdome for that was ſufficiently witneſſed unto them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
as by the fram of Heaven &amp; Earth, and by the Creation,
and Generation of men that were then alive in the World, but
the witneſſe which He gave of Himſelf, or which He left not
Himſelf deſtitute of, it was of His grace, and goodneſſe, and of
that inclination which was in Him to ſhew mercy to men upon
their Repentance, that they might thereupon be ſaved, it did
witneſſe or manifeſt to them, that He had his Armes open to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114759:36"/>
give entertainment to them, and to accept of them upon their
foreſaking of their ſins and turning aſide from their wayes and
workes of unrighteouſneſſe, now this diſpoſition in God a
willingneſſe and readineſſe of ſhewing mercy, <hi>interpretatively</hi>
and <hi>conſtructively</hi> it is a Preaching of Jeſus Chriſt unto men,
and that upon this accompt, becauſe that light of Reaſon in men
which God hath given them at leaſt before they quench it, and
obſcure and bury it under ſin, and wickedneſſe, it hath a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in it to prove by the means which God vouchſafeth unto
them, that there was ſome kinde of attonement, interceſſion,
or mediation made betweene God and man, otherwiſe it was
not poſſible that the World ſhould have ſubſiſted under the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

for us, had not wee lived in an age and place, where we have the
Revelation and Manifeſtation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as it is delivered to
us in the Bible, the Word of God, by what rule ſhould we proceed to
interpret <hi>a ſhower of Raine,</hi> or <hi>a fruitfull Seaſon</hi> into this ſence,
that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is come to ſave ſinners?</p>

               <p>Look after ſuch a manner, or by ſuch a rule of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
as the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (eſpecially before the giving of the Law,)
and as under the ceremonies of the Law they were able to pick
out Jeſus Chriſt and his ſatisfaction for the ſaving of the World;
by the ſame rule and meanes may men gather out, (though not
particularly) the Name of Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>I</hi> do not ſay ſo) but
that which is vertually, and conſtructively and interpretatively,
and for the great end and purpoſe of Salvation every whit as
much as the knowledge of that Name amunts unto, all this <hi>I</hi> ſay
may be learned from thoſe gracious diſpenſation of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God in the World, and my reaſon is; becauſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of man, and that light of underſtanding which God hath put
into him, it is able to bring him to this point, and to fix him
here, that except ſome means had been uſed to pacifie God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the World, it was impoſſible that a God of that infinite
Juſtice ſhould endure ſuch a World of ungodly ones, ſuch a
wicked generation of men as wherewith the whole Earth was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114759:37"/>
repleniſhed from the one end of it unto the other. This I ſay
is nothing but what in a rationall and faire way may be collected
and gathered by thoſe meanes, and by that light of direction,
which God hath <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

to ſay, That a reaſonable Creature, who never heard of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the Gospell (as we doe) either by the Ministry of it
by Men or by Angells from Heaven, may as well gather out a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
interpoſing between the Creature, and Divine Juſtice in a
ſhower of Raine, and a fruitfull Seaſon as the Iewes were able to do
from a Sacrifice and a Prieſt.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, that was not my Anſwer; but this I ſaid,
as that was a very improbable and unlikly way for men to have
gathered out a mediator, eſpecially in thoſe particularities which
Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> did urge in his Argument. Yet look I ſay as there
was a way and means open to the <hi>Jewes</hi> hereby to diſcover <hi>Ieſus
Chriſt,</hi> (though many of them did not finde <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by that
light) ſo I ſay there is a way (though <hi>I</hi> doe not ſay every way
equall) or of the ſame light and efficacy for the giving out of
the knowledge of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> unto men, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> we ſpeak
of had) yet it is of the ſame kinde though a dim, ſaint, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
way and method. And to apply it to the <hi>Iewes</hi> and to the
Heathen, looke as the means vouchſafed unto the one and to the
other to diſcover a Saviour and interceſſour, as the meanes was
but weake and the light dim and faint, ſo like were the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of God (even of that little which they were in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to collect and gather together by this weak light) it was
prepared and ready for them, and that according to the generall
rule of his Providence and Goodneſſe, which is this, <hi>to accept of
Men according to what they have;</hi> that is, according to what
they have power to doe and performe; <hi>and not according to what
they have not.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>Sir, I only crave leave to add this further, The
different reaſon between the Ceremonies of the Iewes diſcovering a
Mediator between God and them, and the mean's which you ſay,
He vouchſafed unto the Gentiles, ſeemes to lye in this; That God
was pleaſed to inſtitute and appoint ſuch <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Temple</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> to ſignifie ſpirituall things which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114759:37"/>
were to come in the times of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> And after he had inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
and appointed ſuch things for ſuch an end, he was pleaſed them
to comment and to gloſs upon them, and to give the ſerve of them,
which made the into pretation of thoſe things eaſie unto the Iews.
But God not having declared in his Word, that he hath appointed
<hi>ſhowers</hi> and <hi>fruitful ſeaſons</hi> to be ſuch interpreters of his minde, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
to ſignifie a <hi>Mediator,</hi> neither having gloſſed upon them; I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
deſire to know how we may proceed to finde out a Saviour, or
to gather ſuch a thing from them.</p>
               <p>As for that which you ſay, <hi>That a man, by reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
may gather much from ſuch ſhowers and fruitful ſeaſons,
concerning the inclinable nature in God to ſhew mercy to a loſt
creature;</hi> I humbly conceive, that the Creature may gather and
collect thus much, That the great God, who created the World,
is a God of infinite Goodneſs and for be drawne; But that this God
hath provided a <hi>Mediator</hi> to make an altonoment between him and
man, this I am not able to conceive how <hi>ſhowers</hi> and <hi>fruitful ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
can diſcover, but his declared minde and will revealed in his
Word.</p>

to anſwer them, and to maintain, <hi>That the Heathen, who never
heard the Gospel, have not a ſufficient mans for the knowledg of
the Gospel.</hi> But becauſe you ſay you are weary, I dare not be ſo
uncivil to preſs you any further at this time.</p>

                  <hi>ſpake to this effect;</hi> I deſire, becauſe there are many
weak Chriſtians here preſent, that are apt to be troubled, and
to despair within themſelves, to hear ſuch differences between
godly and learned men; they will be ready to ſay. <hi>They know not
what to beleeve, nor what Religion to be of:</hi> Therefore I ſhall
onely deſire to inform them this one thing, namely, That the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the two Opinions is not ſo great, but that men,
whether they beleeve the one, or the other, they may be ſaved,
through the Grace of God in Jeſus Christ.</p>

that they keep within the ſphere and compaſs of a Moderator;

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>This is your Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Heathen
who want the Miniſtery of the Goſpell, have not ſufficient means to
believe unto ſalvation.</hi> I am to anſwer your Arguments; you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
and I deny.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>Sir it appertains to me, occupying the place
this day of an Opponent, to ſtate the Queſtion in my own ſenſe,
according to which I ſhall be willing to own it, and to plead
for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>Sir you ſhould have done it, had we not agreed
upon it before: You will have liberty to declare your ſenſe
plainly in urging of your arguments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>We agreed upon the terms, but not the ſtating
of the Queſtion. I conceive it tends to a further benefit, both
to your ſelf, as unto all here preſent, for me to give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
account of my ſenſe in the Queſtion which I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>By no means I ſhall not grant that, becauſe I
had not that liberty my ſelfe; if we had agreed upon it to
have altered any thing in the Queſtion, I ſhould have done
it; I ſhall not grant you any advantage which I had not
my ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I beſeech you thus; do you think that I ſhould
have lookt upon it as an advantage to you, or diſadvantage unto
me, to have given you free liberty to have declared the ſenſe of
your Queſtion: it's contrary to all reaſon, and to the law of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
that any man ſhould lay down his Poſition, and not
be ſuffered to give forth his ſenſe of the queſtion in diſpute.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I appeal to the Moderators, if you pleaſe let
them determine it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>This doth not belong, nor is it any part of the
work of a Moderator to determine that which is the known
law of all diſputes; and without which it is impoſſible that any
diſputation ſhould proceed to any good account to the hearers;
and except I may be ſuffered to ſtate my queſtion, and to give an
account of my ſenſe, and judgement in it, I conceive I have no
ground at all to diſpute upon it, and therefore if I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to do that, I ſhall be willing to proceed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Congregation is already acquainted with
the Queſtion; the former Diſputation ended thus:</hi> That raine
and fruitfull ſeaſons were ſufficient means to preach the Goſpell. <hi>And
the Queſtion now in hand is,</hi> Whether the Heathens have a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency

               <p>If you will ſpeak while I am ſpeaking, and not
give me leave to finiſh what I have to ſay, it is in vaine for me
to diſpute; do but give me leave herein, and I ſhall not be
ſtreightned toward you in giving you the like liberty, or a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

               <p>I beſeech you expect no more liberty, then what
I had of you; we have made choice choice of Moderators, and I appeal
to them in it.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>The thing I deſire is not a liberty, but an abſolute
neceſſity to the buſineſſe in hand, without which it is impoſſible
that we ſhould proceed; it is to no purpoſe to diſpute, except
we firſt agree upon the ſtate of the Queſtion, and explaine the
ſenſe of it, which is ſo reaſonable, that I wonder any man of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
ſhould make any ſtick at it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I deſire not to have any advantage at all in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
neither will I give you any; I deſire not to have my
own will, but to refer it to the Moderators, whether it be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
for you to ſpeak largely to the Queſtion, when I had
not that liberty granted unto me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>We have not choſen Moderators to do any
thing, or to determine any thing againſt the lawes of Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but only to obſerve and overſee the laws thereof.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I conceive it unreaſonable that you ſhould have

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I wonder Sir, that you will offer to open your
mouth in a thing ſo manifeſtly untrue: For what was there
ſpoken by me, or any man with me, that did offer to ſtint, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain,
or prohibit you in that kind? I appeal to all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
whether there was any one word from me, or from any other
to that purpoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I deſire the Moderator to ſpeak: I conceive it
an unreaſonable thing for my Opponent to have more liberty
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114759:40"/>
then I had; and therefore I refer it to you to determine, and if
you agree to it, then I ſhall take the ſame liberty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>In what ſhould I refer my ſelf? To make the
Queſtion now before us (when there is ſo great company of
people met together for their edification) to have it managed
ſo, as that there ſhould be no poſſibility of a right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it, and ſo no probability of any benefit by it.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I conceive the people very well underſtand the
Queſtion, and I deſire you ſo far to ſhew your ſelf ingnuous,
as having choſen Moderators, to refer your ſelf to them: if you
do not look upon them as rationall and honeſt men, why did
you make choice of them?</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I wil refer my ſelfe to the judgement, that is, to
the reaſons which the Moderators ſhall pleaſe to give againſt
my ſenſe in the Queſtion, and if they ſhall give better reaſon
why I ſhould not declare my ſenſe in it, then I can why I ſhould,
I ſhall yeeld to them.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>They ſhall give their Reaſons, and I will give

               <p>If that be their ſenſe, and they ſhall give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
on that hand, that is, why I ought not to declare the ſtate
of the Queſtion in my ſenſe, then I ſhall be willing only to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
my Reaſons with theirs, and ſo let them (and whoſoever

                  <hi>M.</hi> Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I have two Reaſons againſt it: Firſt, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that you ought to have no more liberty as Opponent then I
had, and I had not this liberty granted me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>That's an abſolute untruth; for I beſeech you,
who did reſtrain you from this liberty? Speak to it, ſpeak home,
if you will approve your ſelf for a Chriſtian, who laid theſe
bands of reſtraint upon you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I took it for granted, that I might not have
the liberty, and therefore did but ſtate my Queſtion. My ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114759:41"/>
reaſon why you ought not to have this liberty is this; Here
is a great Congregation, and (for my part) I am perſwaded in
my conſcience, as in the preſence of the Lord, that it is an error
which you hold forth, and I do not hold it fit that where there
are ſo many weak ones, that you ſhould have liberty to hold
forth thoſe things which are erroneous, unleſſe there be ſome to
anſwer you in thoſe Scriptures which you bring, and the reaſons
that you alledge: This is that which lies upon my conſcience,
why I cannot admit the thing you deſire.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>As to that point, I anſwer thus: That if you
deſire to be the man your ſelfe that will give anſwer or reply to
my declaration of my ſenſe in the Queſtion, or rather put it into
the hands of the Moderators, one or both, I am freely content
to allow liberty and full ſcope, and as much time as you will
deſire for the doing of it. But again, another reaſon which I
think will out weigh yours, and that by many degrees, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
of my ſenſe, is this; namely, that by ſome words that fell
from you the laſt day, (as that I did hold forth free will in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to free grace,) I deſire to declare to all the people here
preſent, that you do utterly and abſolutely miſtake and miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
my ſenſe and judgment in theſe Queſtions: For I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
here before God, Angells and men, and all this company
gathered together, that I hold nothing at all, neither free will,
nor any other opinion whatſoever in the leaſt in oppoſition to
free grace: And I know it with the knowledge of aſſurance, that
whenſoever your opinion and mine ſhall be brought into a clear
light, and truly compared, yours will be found the great exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
of free-will, and the great abaſer of free-grace. And the
account thereof is this, becauſe—[<hi>Here M.</hi> Simpſon <hi>interrupted
him, and ſpake thus:</hi>]</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I thinke I ſhall never meet with any man
that holds free-wil, that will ſay, he maintains it in oppoſition to
free-grace: But by ſomething delivered then in that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
(which I doubt not to make evident in ſome other
Diſpute,) you then held forth free-will to the oppoſing, if
not to the overthrowing of free-grace, I mean as it is held forth
in the Goſpell of the Lord Jeſus.</p>

               <p>Sir, there are ſome hundreds of perſons here
preſent, who have been conſtant hearers of my Doctrine in
theſe controverſies, and many of them have heard my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both in publike and private: And I appeal to them all,
<hi>conjunctim &amp; diviſim,</hi> whether ever they heard any word fall
from me, either in publike or in private, which did any wayes
tend to the exaltation or magnifying of free-will in man, or
to the depreſſing, abaſing, and deſtroying of the free grace of
God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, but that I am unwilling to diſturb the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
I could by ſeverall arguments make it evident, that
you overthrow the eternall election of Gods free grace, that
you have laid the ſalvation of man upon the creatures believing,
and not upon the free grace of God, electing; and this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes
free-grace, and ſets up free-will; but I deſire to omit
this at preſent, and ſhall refer it to another oportunity to diſpute
it with you, and in the mean time intreat you to keep to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in hand, having agreed upon the Queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodw.</speaker>
               <p>This I ſay, I conceive the declaration of my ſenſe
in the Queſtion may be of better conſequence, and tend to a
better iſſue, and edification of all that are preſent, then the
Diſpute it ſelf may do: And my Reaſon is this, becauſe I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that when I ſhall have delivered my ſenſe in it, poſſibly it
may tend to a reconcilement of the opinions, and I ſhall be
found to hold nothing in ſo great an oppoſition to you, as you
conceive I do, but that your ſenſe and mine may unaminouſly
agree; and I conceive that ſuch an iſſue and fruit as this, will
anſwer every way, to any benefit whatſoever that may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
accrue unto the people.</p>

               <p>Sir, for the quieting of this difference
betweene you, Mr. <hi>Griffeth</hi> and I have conſidered it
together, and we conceive it very ſutable to the Law of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
that the Queſtion be ſtated before you dispute: But we
conceive, that it belongs to the Respondent to ſtate the Queſtion in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114759:42"/>
what ſenſe he holds it, and in what ſenſe he denies it: And
when he hath made his <hi>Thſis,</hi> declaring in what ſenſe he holds
or denies, then it's lawfull for you to make your <hi>Antitheſis,</hi>
and to declare what you allow of in the Poſition, and what you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>This is the Queſtion,</hi> Whether the Heathen who
want the ministery of the Goſpell, have not ſufficiency of means to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
unto ſalvation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>Very well, I own the terms, if you pleaſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
your ſenſe of it; and in particular touching what ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>means</hi> you underſtand: and the reaſon of my deſire to hear
your ſenſe in that point, is, becauſe there is a double ſufficiency
of means to do a thing: Firſt, <hi>Immediate,</hi> and <hi>Conjunct:</hi> Secondly,
<hi>Remote,</hi> or <hi>Mediate;</hi> Now by an immediate or conjunct ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
I mean the poſſeſſion of ſuch means by which a man is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
enabled without doing any thing more, or obtaining any
thing more then what he hath at preſent to perform the thing:
As for example, in caſe a man doth underſtand a language per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
as the <hi>French,</hi> &amp; withall hath his ſenſe perfect of hearing,
ſuch a man hath an immediate ſufficiency to underſtand the mind
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114759:42"/>
of him, that ſhall ſpeak to him in that language, and needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then what he hath already, the knowledge of
the tongue and his ſenſe of hearing perfectly. But now by a
remote and mediate ſufficiency, I mean ſuch a ſufficiency by
which a man is not able preſently and immediately to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the thing, but yet he is able to doe ſuch things, or
to compaſſe ſuch farther means, by which he ſhall poſſeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of an immediate capacity to doe it: As for example,
though we have not a ſufficiency of meanes at preſent, to ſpeake
or to underſtand him that ſpeakes in an unknowne tongue,
(<hi>Spaniſh,</hi> or the like) yet we have a remote ſufficiency in this
kind, that is, principles of reaſon and underſtanding, by a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
improvement whereof, (as by ſtudy, &amp;c.) we may come
to have ſuch an immediate ſufficiency. Now my ſenſe of the
queſtion in hand is touching this latter ſufficiency of means, I do
not mean that the Gentiles, or any other, have any preſent or
immediate ſufficiency of means to believe, originally given to
them by God, but that they have a remote ſufficiency, that is,
ſuch a ſufficiency of meanes; by the uſe whereof they may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſe
themſelves of ſuch farther meanes, by which they ſhall be
immediately inabled to believe. This for that. Again, for thoſe
words, <hi>the Ministery of the Goſpell;</hi> I would onely put in
theſe words, [<hi>by men</hi>] For I confeſſe there is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of meanes for a man to believe, but by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Goſpell: But now as for ſuch a Miniſtery of
the Goſpell (which I ſuppoſe you intend) as an orall, or
verball Miniſtery of it by men, ſo I ſay, there may be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of meanes for men to believe without the preaching of
the Goſpell, <hi>viz.</hi> by any declaration or manifeſtation of the
truth and ſubſtance of the Goſpell, whether by men, or words,
or what means els ſoever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I deſire to have liberty to ſpeak a few
words (though I did not intend it.)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>You need not deſire liberty to ſpeak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I do find three ſorts of men, who do write
concerning this Queſtion.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Socinus,</hi> and ſome others, who do hold that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
by the light of nature, have ſufficient means to believe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114759:43"/>
to ſalvation: And he holds it upon this account, becauſe he
conceives that God in juſtice is bound to give eternall life unto
that man that walks up unto the principles of nature that are in
him. Now in this ſenſe I deny a ſufficiency of means from the
light of nature: Firſt, becauſe God hath not promiſed to lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
man a ſufficiency of means to him that walks according to
the light of nature. Secondly, I deny it upon this account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no man ever yet did walk according to thoſe principles, as
the Apoſtle doth plainly prove it in the firſt and ſecond chapter
of the Romans.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort that I have met withall, they conceive that
Heathens have not a ſufficiency of means, <hi>proximè,</hi> but <hi>remotè,</hi>
which is the ſame with you: that they have it not immediately
or neerly, but onely remotely; and the principle upon which
they go is this, that <hi>Facienti quod in ſe est, Deus non poteſt dene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare
gratiam:</hi> If a man do that which in him lies according to
the principles of nature, God cannot deny grace to that man.
But I deny this, and ſay, that walking according to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the light of nature in any meaſure, doth not ingage God
to give the light of ſupernaturall grace unto men, for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their ſoules. And I find that many learned <hi>Ieſuites</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this point in this ſenſe, that the Heathens have a ſufficiency
of means to believe unto ſalvation, remotely: and upon this
they bring their <hi>meritum ex congruo;</hi> they ſay that a man doth
not by the merit of congruity deſerve ſupernaturall grace, by
walking according to the principles of nature: but this they
ſay, that it is congruous to the bounty, and goodneſſe, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, to be mercifull to thoſe Heathens who walk up in
ſome meaſure to thoſe principles of nature which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them.</p>
               <p>The third ſort, are thoſe, who apprehend that the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſufficient in it ſelf for the apprehending of ſupernaturall
truths: And I likewiſe deny a ſufficiency of meanes unto the
Heathens to believe to ſalvation in this ſenſe. So that you ſee
plainly what my ſenſe is: I deny that the Heathens, either in a
remote or immediate ſenſe have a ſufficiency of means either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
or internall to believe unto ſalvation. And thus in ſhort,
you have my thoughts concerning the preſent Queſtion.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I hope now the offence is taken out of the way,
and you have had your liberty to ſpeak your mind; and ſince
there was dirt raked out of the kennel, and thrown into my face,
I hope that you will not forbid water towaſh it off: Sir, you
pleaded that you could not give the right hand of fellowſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a perſon that held free-will. Now I muſt profeſſe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, Angells, and men, and unto you, that I hold no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of free-will (if you take the word as the ſound, and the
Gammer of it carries it) in oppoſition in the leaſt unto free
grace: and I am confident, that when your opinion and mine
ſhall be brought together, and duely compared, yours will be
found the great exaltreſſe of free-will in men, and the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſer
of free-grace; for my Opinion is clearly this; —

               <p>I know your opinion very well, this is not to

               <p>I beſeech you give me leave to ſpeak, and if I be
blame-worthy, I will lie under all that reproach that you
throw upon me, but if innocent, there is no reaſon that
the truth of God, or my ſelfe, ſhould lie under prejudice
in the minds and judgements of men: I deſire nothing,
no manner of advantage; but onely to render my ſelfe

               <p>
                  <hi>The Questions being ſtated and agreed upon, which
is this,</hi> VVhether the Heathens, who want the Miniſtery of the
Goſpell by men, have ſufficiency of means to believe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>I pray go on to the proof of it.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>Very well, ſince it can be no better, we
ſhall be willing to doe it. And firſt then, that the Heathens
even without the verball Miniſtery of the Goſpell, have a
ſufficiency of means to believe unto ſalvation, and ſo to be
ſaved: I argue from the 1 Tim. 2. 4. <hi>Who will have all men to be
ſaved, and to come unto the acknowledgement of the truth.</hi> From
whence I argue thus;</p>
               <p>If God will have all men to be ſaved and come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of the truth, then have all men (and ſo
the Heathens, one or other) ſufficient means to be ſaved,
and to come to the acknowledgment of the truth.</p>
               <p>But the will of God is to have all men ſaved, and to come to
the acknowledgment of the truth.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Heathen alſo have ſufficient means to be ſaved,
and to come to the acknowledgment of the truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I can either deny the ſequall of your <hi>Major</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
or can anſwer to your ſecond, or <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition by
diſtinguiſhing.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer therefore rather unto the <hi>Minor</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
thus; That there is a twofold will in God, there is a
<hi>decretive</hi> will, which is irreſiſtible; and a <hi>preceptive</hi> will
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114759:44"/>
of God in his Word: it is not <hi>decretive</hi> will of God, that
all men ſhould be ſaved, but it is his <hi>preceptive</hi> and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will in the means of grace which he doth afford unto men,
that all men ſhould believe unto ſalvation. And in the next
place, this Argument doth not at all reach the thing which we
have in hand; for the Apoſtle doth ſpeak of thoſe who injoy
the Miniſtery of the Goſpel; and all that can be concluded from
it (if we ſhould put your ſenſe upon it) is this, that it is the will
of God that all men ſhould be ſaved, who do injoy the means
of grace; but Heathens (according to us) do not injoy the
means of grace, and therefore this Argument doth not reach the
buſineſſe in hand.</p>

               <p>If you would pleaſe to betake your ſelf to one
ſteddy anſwer, I ſhould know the better how to proceed; but
by your multiplying anſwers, you clearly argue that there is no
ſufficiency in any one of them: And therefore you make a pile
of anſwers, that ſo you may be thought to anſwer ſomthing to

               <p>My anſwer is plaine, I tell you in what ſenſe God
wills that all men ſhould be ſaved, and in what ſenſe he
wills that they ſhould not be ſaved: And now if you pleaſe,
proceed againſt this diſtinction, I ſay that God by his <hi>decretive</hi>
will doth not will the ſalvation of all men, but by his <hi>preceptive</hi>
will, where he affords the means of ſalvation to a people, there
his revealed will is, that all that believe ſhall be ſaved by
Jeſus Chriſt. And I beſeech you proceed againſt this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <p>My anſwer is plaine, that the meaneſt of the

which is this, that God doth not will the ſalvation of

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114759:45"/>
reveals it that all that will believe ſhould be ſaved; ſo that I ſay,
there is a twofold will in God, a <hi>decretive</hi> and a <hi>preceptive</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Cranford.</speaker>
               <p>This is <hi>M. Simpſon</hi>'s Anſwer, that the Text
ſpeaks of the <hi>preceptive</hi> will of God which concerns only thoſe men,
who live within the Pale of the Church, and not at all concerning
his <hi>decretive</hi> will.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>If this Text of Scripture ſpeaks of all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, then it doth not ſpeak only of thoſe which are
within the pale of the Church, but the Text ſpeaks of all men
without exception; therefore it doth not ſpeak only of thoſe
who are within the pale of the Church.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it thus: If ſo be the exigency of the
context, and the ſcope of the place doth evidently require it,
and inforce it, that it ſhould be underſtood of all men without
exception, and not determinately of thoſe withing the Church,
then it is ſo to be meant: But the ſcope and context of the
place (being that which muſt open and determine the ſenſe of
the words) doth neceſſarily and clearly ſhew that it is to be
underſtood of all men without exception; and therefore it is
not to be limited to thoſe that are within the Church.</p>

               <p>I deny your <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition; or if you
pleaſe, I will give you a diſtinction: I grant, that the
Apoſtle in theſe words doth acknowledge an univerſality of
all men; but here I diſtinguiſh <hi>all men,</hi> that is, either
firſt all men, of all ſorts, qualities and conditions, rich
and poore, high and low: Or ſecondly, all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception of any, all men in the world. I grant an
univerſality in the firſt ſenſe, that it is the will of God, that
all men, that is, that men of all ſorts and conditions ſhould be
ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt; but that it is not according to the
<hi>decretive</hi> will of God, that all men without exception ſhould
be ſaved: And this I conceive to be the plaine meaning
of the Text, and the ground and reaſon why hee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114759:45"/>
would have us pray for all men.</p>

<hi>M. Goodwin.</hi> Sir, if you pleaſe, go on where you was, and prove that
the ſcope of the Context doth require it to be understood of all men,
and not of all ſorts and ranks of men only.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it thus: If ſo be a limited ſenſe of all
ſorts and ranks of men, will render the Apoſtle in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of his incongruous, defective, and indeed ridiculous,
then the other ſenſe, namely, the generall and univerſall, which
reſpects all men without exception, is that which is here meant.
But the limited ſenſe determining it to all ranks and ſorts of
men onely, this makes the Apoſtle weak, defective, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in his Context and diſcourſe; and therefore it is the other
ſenſe that is to be taken.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Simpſon.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I deny the ſequell of your <hi>major</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Griffeth.</speaker>
               <p>How Sir, what the ſequell of the major?</p>

            <sp>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>Then I prove it that the limited ſenſe makes the
Apoſtle weake, and defective in his Argument, thus: Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it is from the Context, that the Apoſtle in theſe
two Verſes, the third and fourth, doth deliver a motive or
Argument to preſſe his exhortation delivered in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Verſes. This is cleare from this illative or rationative
particle [<hi>for:] I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for
all men, for Kings, and for all that are in authority, that
we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſty.
[For] this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour,
who will have, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there is nothing more pregnant and evident then
that there is a motive delivered in theſe two Verſes, to
preſſe the exhortation delivered in the two former: Now
then I ſay, if ſo be we ſhall take this phraſe, <hi>all men,</hi>
here in this motive to the Exhortation, in a limited ſenſe, it
makes the ſenſe of the motive to be directly oppoſite to the
exhortation, and not any way conducing to the preſſing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114759:46"/>
and urging of it, and that I demonſtrate thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moderator.</hi> I pray draw up your ſenſe into a ſhort ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>For matter of context it will not readily come
into a ſyllogiſme, but we will try what may be done. Thus then I
prove it, that that ſenſe will make the Apoſtle ridiculous in his
argument.</p>
               <p>If ſo be ſuch a ſenſe, which will make the motive incongruous,
incoherent, nay oppoſite unto that very end for which it is
brought, will render the Apoſtle ridiculous; then ſuch a
ſenſe we ſpeak of (a limited ſenſe) will render him ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p>But to bring a motive which is quite contrary and oppoſite
to the exhortation which it is brought to promote and
preſſe; this makes the Apoſtle (or whoſoever doth it) ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
defective, and weak in his argument.</p>
               <p>Therefore this is contrary to the Apoſtles meaning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffeth. M. Simpſon <hi>be pleaſed to repeat Mr.</hi> Goodwins
<hi>argument.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I will give it you in a ſhorter ſyllogiſm: That which
makes the motive incongruous, doth make the Apoſtle ridiculous;
but this ſenſe makes the motive incongruous, and therefore
it make the Apoſtle ridiculous. Now I deny your <hi>minor</hi>
Propoſition, and ſay that it doth not make the motive incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous.</p>
            </sp>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>If ſo be the ſenſe of the Apoſtles exhortation in
the two former verſes be generall, that he would have Chriſtians
to pray, and make interceſſions for all men without exception:
Then to bring this as a reaſon that God will have ſome to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and not all, it is to make the motive incongruous to the
exhortation, and conſequently the Apoſtle ridiculous in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Cranford.</speaker>

               <p>You ſee the ſubſtance, and I beleeve the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of it, which makes you contend againſt the form and figure
of it: it is this, if the Apoſtles exhortation was to have all
men without exception prayed for, then his motive to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
muſt be this, that God would have all men without
exception to be ſaved: But the Apoſtles exhortation, the tenor
of it is to have all men without exception prayed for, and not
only all ſorts, degrees, and kinds of men; and therefore requiſite it
is, that the motive ſhould be underſtood of all men: for the
motive muſt be as large, and commenſurable with the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
and conſequently if all in the one muſt be underſtood
of all men without exception, then muſt it be ſo underſtood in
the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>You do not diſpute according to order, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
you are to bring in the Propoſition denied in the ſyllogiſme,
which is not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Cranford.</speaker>
               <p>It is in, and the ſyllogiſme is very good, which is
this: That which makes the reaſon ſhorter then the exhortation,
makes the Apoſtles argument ridiculous: but this limited interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
doth ſo: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it thus; That the Apoſtle in his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
unto Chriſtians to pray for all men; by all men he doth
mean all men without exception; not <hi>genere ſingulorum,</hi> but
<hi>ſingulari generum:</hi> not all kinds of men, but all particulars in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
kind. This I prove from the ſecond verſe; if ſo be the
Apoſtle doth here injoyne and exhort, that <hi>prayers be made</hi>
for all particulars of one ſort of men: and there can be no
reaſon given, why prayers ſhould not be made for all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114759:47"/>
of any ſort of men, then it is an evident caſe that he doth
exhort that Prayers be made for all particulars of every ſort
of men: But evident it is, that the Apoſtle exhorts that
prayers be made for all particulars in one rank or ſort of
men: Therefore certaine it is, that Prayers ſhould bee
made for all particulars in every ſort or kinde of
men.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I will repeat your Argument, and put it into form
thus; If the Apoſtle in his Exhortation would have all men to
be ſaved, [M. Cranford, <hi>No, all the particulars in one kind</hi>] then
he commands that prayers be made for every particulars of all
ſorts; but God would have all men to be ſaved of one kind:
<hi>Ergo.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>M. Goodwin's</hi> Argument is this, If the Apoſtle
exhorts that Prayers ſhould bee made for every particular
in one kind or ſort of men; and there can bee no reaſon given
why prayers ſhould not be made for every particular of all ſorts,
then it is plaine, that he exhorts that prayers ſhould he made
for all particulars in every ſort and kind of men; but it is evident,
that he exhorts that prayers be made for all particulars of one ſort of
men: Ergo.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer by denying your <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition,
and ſay, that the Apoſtle doth not will us to pray for all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men in the world without exception, that they may be
ſaved, there are a people for whom Chriſt prayed not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Griffeth.</speaker>
               <p>The minor is this, that the Apoſtle exhorts

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay, that every particular perſon without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception

            <sp>

               <p>If every particular in one ſort of men ſhould be prayed

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it clearly from the ſecond <hi>verſe; For
Kings, and for all that are in authority.</hi> From hence I gather that, If
Chriſtians ought to pray (as in the Apoſtles exhortation) for
all without exception, that are in authority; then he commands
that prayers be made for all particular perſons in one rank or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of men; and that too of ſuch a rank and order which the
Chriſtians then might have thought of all other ranks of men
ſhould not have been prayed for, becauſe they were the greateſt
enemies in thoſe dayes unto the Chriſtian Faith. And that's the
reaſon why he doth ſpecifie, and inſtance eſpecially in them: to
ſhew that he would have all men without exception, (as well
the greateſt enemies of the Church, as thoſe that may ſeeme
more friendly to them,) prayed for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>Your argument is this: If the Apoſtle would
have us to pray for all men that are in authority without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
then it is his will that we ſhould pray for all men of all ſorts.
I deny the Minor Propoſition: it is not the will of God that
we pray for all that ſort; that is, for their ſalvation: we may
pray for thoſe who are in authority, <hi>that we may lead a quiet and
a peaceable life</hi> under them: But abſolutely to pray for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their ſoules, that I deny.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Good.</speaker>
               <p>I prove that the Apoſtles exhortation is, that we
ſhould pray for all, even for their ſalvation, and that firſt from
your own principle; which ſaith, that it is the preceptive will
of God that all men ſhould be ſaved. If it be the Apoſtles
minde that the preceptive will of God ſhould take place: then
it is his minde, that the ſalvation of all that are in authority
ſhould be prayed for. But it is the mind of the Apoſtle, and the
will of Chriſt himſelfe, that the preceptive will of God ſhould
take place, and be prayed for, <hi>to be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</hi>
Therefore certain it is, that the meaning of the Apoſtle is, that
the ſalvation of all that are in authority ſhould be prayed for.</p>
               <p>And beſides, it is evident from the motives thus, <hi>who will have
all men to be ſaved;</hi> which is the very reaſon, why he enjoynes,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114759:48"/>
and requires prayer for theſe men; becauſe he will have all men
to be ſaved; Therefore the intent of the Apoſtle is, that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſhould be made for all men, for their ſalvation.</p>

               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>Thus you reaſon, you ſay you will prove it from
our own principle, that if it be the preceptive will of God, that
all men ſhould be ſaved; then it is according to the will of God
that we ſhould pray for the ſalvation of all men: But (ſay you)
according to our own principle, it is the preceptive will of God
that all men ſhould be ſaved. <hi>Ergo,</hi> To this I anſwer, that there is
praying for men two manner of wayes; Firſt abſolutely; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
conditionally. We are not to pray abſolutely for the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all men, not knowing whether God intended to damn them,
or to ſave them: But we are to pray for all men conditionally, that
is, if they be ſuch for whom Chriſt died, and belong to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of grace: In this ſence we are to pray for the ſalvation of all
men, yet with ſubmiſſion to the will of God in the thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Good.</speaker>
               <p>I argue againſt that diſtinction, that the will of God
is, that we pray for all men, not abſolutely, but conditionally.
If ſo be that the will of God be, and the Apoſtles intent is, that
we ſhould pray for all men conditionally: Then Gods will is
onely conditionall, that all men ſhould be ſaved. But Gods will is
not conditionall, (for it is expreſt here, <hi>who will have all men to be
ſaved.</hi>) And therefore for you to diſtinguiſh and make that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,
which the Apoſtle makes abſolute. And for you to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
that men ſhould do that conditionally, which God hath
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded ſimply, poſitively, &amp; abſolutely, without any condition:
In this caſe you are not an interpreter, but a maker of <hi>new</hi> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
and you put your own ſence upon the word of God.</p>

               <p>I beſeech you Sir, ſpeak nothing againſt me,

that the Saints ſhould pray for all men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Good.</speaker>
               <p>That which God commands to be done abſolutely,
(namely, without any manner of condition) that is to be done
abſolutely, and without condition: But God commands that
all men in authority ſhould be prayed for, without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or limitation: And therefore it is the will of God that all
thoſe ſhould be prayed for ſimply and abſolutely.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simpſon.</speaker>
               <p>I deny the ſecond Propoſition: It is not the will
of God that we ſhould pray abſolutely, for the ſalvation of all
men and women in the world without exception; Chriſt did
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114759:48"/>
not pray ſo: and we are to pray in faith: but we cannot have
faith to believe that God will ſave all men. Nay, it is contrary
to the Scripture, therefore we are not to pray for all men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>If ſo be that the Apoſtle here injoynes prayers to be
made for all men, without the mention of any condition in this
kind; and no ſuch condition can be proved from any other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
Then we are to follow the expreſneſs of the Letter, and
not to reſtraine, ſtifle, and quench the ſpirit of his meaning by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
limitation, or diſtinction of our own: for that doth amount to
a making of new Scriptures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>It belongs to you Sir not to ſpeak ſo much: The
propoſition which you are to prove is, that the Apoſtle injoynes
all men to be prayed for without any limitation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>The propoſition is, that the Apoſtle injoynes all
men in Authority to be prayed for, and this proves that by all in
the motive to this Argument, muſt be meant all men without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception:
For <hi>all men</hi> in the exhortation, and <hi>all men</hi> in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to it, muſt be of one and the ſame extent.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>There is a plain exception againſt this, for we gave
this diſtiction before; that by all, is not meant all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
but all ſorts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you by all, is meant all ſorts of People.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>There is not a jot or title of anſwer in what you ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>The diſtinction I made uſe of is this, That it is not
the mind of God, that all men without exception ſhould come
to the knowledge of the truth, but ſome of all ſorts of men. And
likewiſe that it is not the will and mind of God, that we ſhould
pray abſolutely for the converſion and ſalvation of all men, but
onely for the ſalvation of thoſe that are elected, whom
God did intend to ſave by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> from all eternity. Now
if you have any thing more to ſay, ſpeak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>You have anſwered nothing to the purpoſe, for
here the words of the Text are, <hi>For Kings, and for [all] that are
in Authority:</hi> Now whether here be any reſtraint or limitation
put upon the prayers of Chriſtians for all thoſe that are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
I leave to judge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:114759:49"/>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>I can prove that by all in Scripture, is meant all of
ſuch a quality, ſuch a ſtate and condition: And I ſay ſo it is taken
here: And the Apoſtle doth plainly hint it forth, when he ſpeaks
of theſe particulars, for he doth not ſpeak of all particular men
without exception; but men of ſuch a ſort and condition: ſo that
if you have any plain Argument to overthrow this diſtinction,
we ſhall be willing to heare it. Otherwiſe it is but <hi>Petitio princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pii,</hi>
A begging the Queſtion, and not proving of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>No Sir, the Scripture is plain, and it hath been
proved, that by all men in the <hi>4th.</hi> verſe, muſt of neceſſity be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<hi>all</hi> without exception. The Argument to prove it was,
becauſe the exhortation in the 1. verſe, is to have <hi>all men</hi> prayed
for: And to prove what theſe <hi>men</hi> were, the ſecond verſe holds
forth, <hi>viz.</hi> That he would have all particulars of one ſort, and
rank of men to be prayed for; and conſequently if all of one ſort,
then all of every ſort: And therefore by <hi>all men</hi> in the former
verſe, muſt be meant all men without exception: The proceſs of
this diſcourſe is ſo clear, pregnant and regular, that men of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
cannot but own it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cranf.</speaker>
               <p>I beſeech you conſider, your fixſt Argument was this,
that the Gentiles have ſufficient meanes <hi>remotè</hi> of coming to faith,
and by faith to ſalvation: your Text to prove it was this: <hi>God
would have all men to be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Simpſons</hi> diſtinction is
this, that all men ſignifies onely all ſorts of men, that are within the
ſound of the Goſpel: your diſproofe of this was from the Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
that <hi>all men</hi> muſt ſignifie every particular man: your reaſon was,
becauſe every particular man was to be prayed for: To prove that,
you cite the ſecond verſe, becauſe all Kings were to be prayed for,
and every particular of that ſort: Now Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> doth deny the
conſequence; that though every particular King, and all in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhould be prayed for, yet it will not follow from thence, that every
particular man in the world ſhould be prayed for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> will own that Argument, we will
anſwer to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, that it is the will of God that we ſhould
pray for Kings, and all that are in Authority, that they may rule
well; but it is not the will of God, that we ſhould pray abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
for their ſalvation.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:114759:49"/>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>That's not the queſtion, but whether we may pray
at all for their ſalvation. If you will take away my Argument,
you muſt either prove that all of one ſort are not to be prayed
for: Or if ſo, that yet notwithſtanding, all of another ſort are
not to be prayed for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>My anſwer is this, which I will ſtand by, that the
Apoſtle here doth not mean all men without exception; but all
ſorts of men: And I conceive that it is not the mind of God, nor
of the Apoſtle, that we ſhould pray for all particular Kings, for
their ſalvation, now if you can diſprove this anſwer, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
it. I ſhall grant you the <hi>Queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>I proved that it is the mind of the Apoſtle, that all
Kings, and all that are in Authority ſhould be prayed for. As to
the matter of ſalvation, I beſeech you conſider, that is nothing
at all to the Argument. For what is to be proved is, that all that
are in Authority are to be prayed for, whether conditionally or
not, that is not the buſineſs, but that they are to be prayed for.
And if that be granted (which is the expreſſe and undeniable let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the words, and cannot be avoided.) Then it doth evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow, that by all men in the <hi>4th.</hi> verſe, muſt of neceſſity be
underſtood all men without exception: otherwiſe the motive
will be incommenſurable, and narrower then the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Cranf.</speaker>
               <p>I beſeech you Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> conſider it, there are
two things which Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> deſires to be proved: The firſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the objects to be prayed for: you cite, <hi>all Kings, and all that
are in Authority:</hi> He ſaith, not all Kings, but onely thoſe that are
within the noiſe of the Goſpel, under which there are Chriſtians: That
theſe Chriſtians <hi>may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and honeſty.</hi> Secondly, he ſaith further, not for their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but that under them <hi>we may lead a peaceable and quiet life,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> will ſtand to this anſwer, let him
but own it, and we will anſwer it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>I ſtand to my own anſwer, which is this, That the
motive is anſwerable to the precept: The precept is for the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for all men; The motive is that it is the mind of God, that all
ſorts of people ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>

               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:114759:50"/>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>Though that be nothing to the Argument, yet I
will go along with you; for the Argument is clearly founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the expreſs words of the ſecond verſe, which are, <hi>For Kings,
and all that are in Authority,</hi> and not onely for thoſe that are in
the Church, and under the ſound of the Goſpel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>Your conſequence cannot be proved, for we ſay
the motive is anſwerable to the precept.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>The conſequence is proved to my hand, by the Holy
Ghoſt himſelf; who expreſly here affirm's, that he would have all
men, not all ſorts of men only: he doth not ſay that he would have
all ſorts of Magiſtrates that are in Authority; but all Magiſtrates
to be prayed for: And you come in with words, and turn the
Scripture up-ſide-down, and quite dèſtroy the life and power of
the Apoſtles meaning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay that the Apoſtle doth not mean all men, but
all ſorts of men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>Your anſwer is not to purpoſe; but I muſt go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with you, in your wild chaſe. If the Apoſtles exhortation
be this, that he would have all ſorts of men to be prayed for;
then his meaning is, that he would have them prayed for,
either as corporations and rankes, and ſpecies of men; or elſe as
they are orders of men, conſiſting of ſo many particulars and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals:
but his ſenſe and meaning, neither is that he would
have them prayed for, as they are communities of men, nor yet
as they are particular men in every calling: therefore his mind
and meaning is not, that he would have all ſorts and rankes of
men onely to be prayed for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer to your minor propoſition, it is the will
of God that we ſhould pray for all ſorts of men, look upon them
in corporations, and look upon them as particular perſons: It is
the mind of God I ſay, that we pray for all particular men, of all
ſorts, qualities, rankes and conditions, not knowing who ſhall be
ſaved, and who ſhall be damned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>Very well then, you and I are agreed; for this is all
that I ſay, that all ſorts and particulars of men ought to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for in order to ſalvation: Now you are come home to my
ſenſe; and I hope we ſhall have a good iſſue of the buſineſs in the
concluſion.</p>

               <p>Conſider it I beſeech you, you put in the word
<hi>ſalvation</hi> now, it was not in your ſyllogiſme, for it was deny'd,

               <p>I deny that. It is one thing to pray for all men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difinitely,

               <p>This is my ſence in that propoſition, namely, that all
men as they are men, and before they put themſelves into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
of being prayed for; ſo all men I ſay are to be prayed for,
&amp; you bring a Scripture to prove that ſome men, that have put
themſelves out of a capacity of being prayed for; are not to be
prayed for. I do not ſay that all men in any condition; after any
degree of ſining whatſoever (as for example, the ſinne againſt the
Holy Ghoſt) that ſuch men as theſe ought to be prayed for: But
I ſay that all men conſidered ſimply as men are to be prayed for.</p>

               <p>Theſe are words which you bring in now: not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned: your propoſition is univerſall without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that all men are to be prayed for: And I give a clear Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

               <p>My argument is not falſe becauſe I did not intend,
nor did I ſay that all men in [any condition] were to be prayed
for, but as they come into the world: I told you in what ſence
I affirme it: And the reaſon why I did not diſtinguiſh and limit
it; was becauſe I did not thinke any man would be ſo irrationall
as to conceive that I did include thoſe that ſin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </speaker>
               <p>The thing that you have indeavoured to prove is,
that the Apoſtle in that place of <hi>Timothy,</hi> exhorts that prayers
ſhould be made for all men in generall; but we prove, that that
cannot be the ſence, becauſe it is contrary to another Apoſtle, as
in this place of <hi>John.</hi>

               <p>Nay I tell you, it is not contrary to that Scripture
though it ſhould be taken in ſuch a ſence, becauſe thoſe very
perſons who are there excluded by reaſon of that ſin: The very
ſame perſons before the committing thereof, were capable of
prayers; and conſequently all men are to be prayed for: yea
theſe men themſelves are not excepted in reference to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>The thing which you have indeavoured to prove
(though not able) was that the Apoſtle in theſe words did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that all men without exception were to be prayed for: But
by what we bring from <hi>John,</hi> it is plain that all cannot be taken in
that ſence.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Good.</speaker>
               <p>That in <hi>John</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe, and I prove
it thus: The committing of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt,
doth not multiply perſon in the World: doth not make more
ſoules to be in the world then there were: And I ſay that all
perſons, even theſe, before they had ſinned that ſinne; they were
included in the Apoſtles [all.] And you cannot prove that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Perſon in the world then had committed the ſin againſt the
Holy Ghoſt: and if you could, yet this was not to the purpoſe;
for even theſe very perſons, before they had committed
that ſinne, were perſons to be prayed for, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhewed there was a poſitive Command, that
we ſhould not pray for ſome men: therefore what Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
ſaith, cannot be according to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt.
I beſeech you ſpeak ſomething, that we may not ſpend all our

               <speaker>M. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I conſider the People, and I think it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Good.</speaker>
               <p>I conceive it moſt profitable, for as the light of the
Sun is more profitable then the light of all the Stars, ſo one
Scripture where the truth is evident, pregnant, and cleare, may
be of more concernment to the people, and more edifying to
them then many.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Cranf.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, you have waded in this Argument, I conceive,
as farre as your Argument will drive from this Scripture. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of all is this: you contend that every ſingular man in the
world is to be prayed for; at leaſt under this notion of a man, <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
homo.</hi> Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> he peremptorily denies this Propoſtion:
he cites out Text of Scripture, which is, 1 <hi>John 5. There is a ſinne
unto death, I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it.</hi> You ſay, that
that ſinne doth not multiply perſons, but ſtates: and that a man, as a
man, was to have been prayed for; before ſuch time as he ſinned that
ſinne. He objects and ſayes, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> knew a ſort of men, <hi>as
men,</hi> that were not to be prayed for. But I conceive ſo farre as I am
able to underſtand, that you are both gone from the main queſtion you
began with; which was, whether God had given ſufficient meanes of
faith and ſalvation unto thoſe Gentiles to whom he had not given the
Goſpel?</p>

               <p>All this while I ſay, I have proſecuted the queſtion,

you find fault, and take offence that I anſwer not to another
queſtion, which is eſſentially and notoriouſly different from it?
For it is not material <hi>what</hi> meanes they have, but whether they

               <p>Vnder favour, this I conceive is the queſtion in hand,
<hi>whether the Heathen, who want the miniſtery of the Goſpel,
have ſufficient meanes unto ſalvation:</hi> This queſtion according to
your own ſenſe, as you ſtated it. Firſt, by the miniſtery of the Goſpel,
you underſtand onely a <hi>Declaration by words:</hi> There might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes beſides this miniſtery of the Goſpel by men, which the
Heathen might injoy: And Secondly, By ſufficient meanes to believe
to ſalvation; you ſtated ſufficiency, <hi>proximè &amp; remotè,</hi> neere and
remote, mediate and immediate: And you aſſert that the Heathen
have ſuch meanes, (which though they were not <hi>proximè</hi> yet <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè,</hi>
that is, by doing ſome act or thing which they had a power to do
thoſe meanes might be made effectual for their ſalvation: Now I
conceive you have varied the ſtate of the queſtion; for you now go upon
the <hi>meritorious cauſe of ſalvation,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt died for the
Heathen promiſcuouſly.</p>

did not determine or preſcribe, neither is there any thing in the
words of the queſtion to bear it; how, or what kind of meanes
they have; for it may be very hard to determine and preſcribe
that: but this is that which I undertake to prove, that a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of meanes, they have vouchſafed unto them by God for
that end.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, The ingagement that lies upon me to prove
is, <hi>that the Heathen have ſufficient meanes to believe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
And if you will take the argument it is thus. If ſo be
that Jeſus Chriſt, gave him ſelfe a ranſom for thoſe Heathens,
who have not the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, as well as for thoſe
that have; then as well the one as the other have ſufficient
meanes unto ſalvation: But Chriſt gave him ſelfe a ranſome
for thoſe who have not the Miniſtery of the Goſpell, as well
as for thoſe that have, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>The minor Propoſition is denyed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it thus. If ſo be that Chriſt did not give
himſelfe a ranſome for thoſe who want the Goſpel, as well as
for thoſe that have it: then he put a difference between men
and men, in giving himſelfe a anſome; But he did not put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between men and men, in giving himſelf a ranſome: And
therefore he gave himſelf a ranſome, as well for thoſe who want
the miniſtery of the Goſpel, as for thoſe that have it: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
vouchſafes a ſufficiency of meanes, as well to the one
as to the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>We deny the Minor againe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it thus. If ſo be that Chriſt did put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between men and men, in giving himſelfe a ranſome; then
this difference was put by him, according to the will &amp; pleaſure
of God the Father: But the will and pleaſure of God the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114759:54"/>
Father was not, that Chriſt ſhould put any difference between
men and men, in giving himſelfe a ranſome: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>If ſo be that it was the <hi>will</hi> of God that Jeſus
Chriſt ſhould put a difference between men and men in giving
himſelfe a ranſome then this <hi>will</hi> of his was either taken up, and
conceived by him at that very inſtant of time when Chriſt did
give himſelfe for a ranſome, or ſome time before, or from
Eternity: But ſuch a will in God that Chriſt ſhould put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene men in giving himſelfe a ranſome was neither
canceived in him at that time when he did give him ſelf a ranſom,
nor befor, nor from eternity: Therefore there was no ſuch
will in God, that ſuch a difference ſhould be made.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>If there was no <hi>reprobation of perſons,</hi> according to

God, that Chriſt ſhould put a difference between men and men,
in dying for them: But certain it is, that there was no <hi>reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Therefore there could be no reprobation of particular perſons,

               <p>I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing thus, perſons are ſaid to
be either in reſpect of their own being in the world; or elſe as
they are in <hi>decreto divino,</hi> the divine decree: We ſay that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were not in being as we are now upon earth: But they had

               <speaker>M. Good.</speaker>
               <p>If ſo be perſons as they were in that decree of God,

ſuch a being, they were not reprobated from eternity: But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

conſidered, as in the decree of God, were not capable of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Simp.</speaker>
               <p>I deny your Propoſition, they may be reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as perſons having a being in the decree, and foreknowledge
of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Good.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it thus: If ſo be the decrees of God, are
nothing elſe but God himſelf, infinite: And men as they had a
being from eternity, it was nothing elſe, nor no other being,
but God himſelf: Then if they ſhould be reprobated from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
it muſt be God himſelf that muſt be reprobated.</p>

indeed the blaſphemy of it; for this doth directly follow upon it:
There was no being from eternity but God himſelf, all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that were were onely God; and therefore if you ſay, that
there was a reprobation of perſons from eternity, it muſt be the
reprobation of God himſelf; which is the moſt horrid and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
conſequence of your opinion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cranf. Sir,</speaker>
               <p>I pray you, had not all things a futurition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the decree of God? and is there no diſtinction in his decree, in
reſpect of <hi>voluntas,</hi> and <hi>voluntatis;</hi> the decree of God, as it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the will of his decree, is one thing; and as it had reſpect to the
Decree of his Will is another. Take it in this latter ſence, and ſo
it doth produce another thing out of nothing.</p>

that there was no man that had a Being from Eternity, no creature

God, and conſequently God himſelf: or elſe you muſt ſay that there

God is God, and the fore-knowledg of God is God: But there are
likewiſe Objects of this Decree and fore-knowledge of his, and we
ſay, that theſe Objects may have a Being in the Divine Decree, and
yet may not be God. As for inſtance; If we ſhall conceive that
God fore-ſees any particular thing, muſt we therefore hold, That
that thing which is fore-ſeen by him muſt needs be God?</p>

no creatures from Eternity: Therefore there was nothing but God

               <p>I muſt here come in with the ſame Anſwer again,
becauſe your Argument is the ſame: There were creatures, though
not actually exiſting, and in Being, yet in the Divine Decree:

For ſtill you run in a circle; and here is nothing but <hi>Idem par
Idem.</hi>

               <p>I grant, That all men were in God, as in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
cauſe; otherwiſe, if they had not been in him ſo, it was
impoſſible that ever they ſhould have had any Being at all: They
were in God, as the Roſe in Winter is in the root of the tree: Now
we cannot ſay, ſome of the Roſes flouriſh, and ſome of them are
withered, whilſt they have no other Being then what they have in
the root. So, though all men are in God from Eternity, yet we
cannot ſay there was any difference in them then; for if there
ſhould, the difference muſt be in the Nature and Being of God
himſelf.</p>

               <p>Pray will you pleaſe to conſider this, for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Congregation: I think it is concluded among you all,
That God knew all his Work from the beginning; and why might
not God from eternity dispoſe of his creatures, to whom be would
give Being in time, as you or I may diſpoſe of a houſe, which we
intend to build in time. Mr. <hi>Sympſons</hi> opinion is, That God <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
times and ſeaſons</hi> from eternity: and before ſuch time as
he gave creatures their Being, he diſpoſed of them what he would
do with them: And this Decree, and Fore-knowledg, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of God, as it respects and reflects inwardly upon God, as
it is <hi>Actus eminens,</hi> it is God himſelf; but as it is determined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the creature, ſo it is tranſient, and not God.</p>

               <p>We grant, That all things had a true and real Being
in God, and that from eternity; and that it was free for God to
make what Laws and Decrees he pleaſed in himſelf, for the diſpoſing
of theſe creatures of his when they ſhould come forth into actual
and material Being: But this is that we ſay further, That though God
did decree from eternity concerning the diſpoſition of ſuch and ſuch
creatures of his; yet he did not then actually diſpoſe of them:
Now Election and Reprobation do not import the Decrees of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
and Reprobation; but they reſpect the execution and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Decree it ſelf.</p>

the Propoſition in mind which you are to prove; namely, <hi>That
things which are not actually exiſtent cannot have a Being in the
Divine Decree:</hi> I can prove, That things which are not in actual
Being had yet a Being in God: <hi>Jeremy was made a Prophet by the
Decree of God before he was formed in the womb:</hi> which ſhews,
that there is a difference between the Object of Gods Decree, and

before he had a Being, he was the Object of Gods Decree, but

               <p>This is the thing which I grant, There is a difference
(ſome kind of difference indeed) between God, and the Decrees of
God; yet really, and ſubſtantially, they are but one and the ſame:
And though there be a difference herein, yet notwithſtanding it is
not ſuch, as that the Objects of theſe Decrees, as they were in God,
ſhould be capable of Election or Reprobation.</p>

               <p>The Argument which I have urged againſt <hi>Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Eternity,</hi> I conceive it is ſo clear and obvious, and lies ſo
near the underſtanding and capacity of the weakeſt who are preſent,
that there is none of them all but may fully and clearly apprehend it,
namely this, That it is impoſſible there ſhould be any thing reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from eternity that was not: And again, That there was nothing
from eternity but God himſelf.</p>

               <p>I conceive there is none here ſo irrational, but
can eaſily diſtinguiſh between the Decree of God, and the Object
of that Decree: You are to prove, That the Object of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
is God himſelf.</p>

               <p>If by Object you meane any thing that was from
eternity, <hi>I</hi> have proved it already, if you meane any thing elſe,
it is not to the point: I am to prove that there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
from Eternity: Now if there was no Object
from Eternity, then there could bee no ſuch Act from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>But the time is paſt, and I have ſpent my ſelfe, and fear that
I have incurr'd ſome inconvenience in my health: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<hi>I</hi> have been freely willing to give teſtimony to the
Truth of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: which will be witneſſed at the
great Day of His appearing: And till then, I ſhall be willing to
lie under what reproach either you, or whoſoever elſe, ſhall
caſt upon me. I have ſtood up here as you ſee, and denied my
ſelf many wayes in the thing; and ſhall now refer both my cauſe
and yours to the righteous judgement of God; who we are ſure
cannot be deceived.</p>

               <p>Sir, you was pleaſed to ſignifie unto the People,
that your Argument lies ſo neare to their underſtanding, that
there are none heere preſent but are capable of it, and can carry it
away: namely, that there can be no Decree of Reprobation from
Eternity, becauſe there was no Object of Reprobation, only God
Himſelf: which is as much as to ſay, I cannot determine what I
will doe with any Worke, which I purpoſe to make hereafter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that Worke is not yet in being. Take Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
for the Decree of God, how He will diſpoſe of ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
when they ſhall have a being, this might be from Eternity,
though the Creatures themſelves had not then an actuall being:
But if you take Election and Reprobation, (as you ſeeme to hint)
for the execution of this Decree in time, none oppoſes; For,
<hi>known unto God of old are all His Workes.</hi> And therefore
if the People underſtand the Argument, they underſtand no more
but this, that GOD could not execute His Decrees, but in
Time.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>fully accord, and cloſe with you in this; and
deſire the People to take knowledge of it, that there is no Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Reprobation from Eternity; but Decrees of Election and
Reprobation only: which I fully and freely aſſent unto, and
am of the ſame judgement with you herein: I ſay there is no
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114759:58"/>
Reprobation of perſons from Eternity, becauſe it is impoſſible
there ſhould be any perſons from Eternity: But the Decrees of
God being nothing elſe but God Himſelf, therefore to deny ſuch
Decrees from Eternity, is to deny God Himſelf: But this is that
which I deny, that theſe Decrees reſpect perſons perſonally
conſidered: but they only reſpect Species of men; As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
The Decree of Election from Eternity was, <hi>that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
believes ſhould be ſaved:</hi> and on the contrary <hi>that who ever
lives and dies in unbelief ſhould be condemned;</hi> this is the Decree
of Reprobation: And this is that which I ſay that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Decree of Election and Reprobation from Eternity but only
this: And ſo I have done.</p>

               <p>There is a Propoſition which lies upon you to
prove, namely, that the Object of Gods Decree, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
it ſelf are the ſame: If you have any ability therefore in
you, either prove it becauſe you make it ſuch an invinciable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
or elſe go off as you did the laſt time, not able to make

which was to prove that the Workes of Creation were a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

               </speaker>
               <p>I deſire leave to ſpeake a few words, and ſo we
ſhall conclude: The ground and occaſion of the firſt Diſpute
with Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> it was ſome difference between Maſter
<hi>Goodwins</hi> People and others: And the end of it was for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
not for Contention. When we came together,
the firſt Queſtion was concerning Univerſall Redemption;
where M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> did aſſert this Poſition, that <hi>Chriſt did die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally
on His Fathers part, and on His own, to ſave all the
Poſterity of Adam:</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> was oponent, and he urged
this Argument, that if God did love all, then He did intend the
Salvation of all, by the Death of Jeſus Chriſt; There was an
Anſwer then given unto that Scripture which he then urged,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114759:58"/>
3 <hi>John.</hi> But I paſſe from thence, and come to the ſecond Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
which lay upon Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> to prove the contrary;
that <hi>Chriſt did not die on His Fathers part, nor on His own part
for the Salvation of all Men intentionally.</hi> M. <hi>Sympſon</hi> urged
ſeverall Arguments againſt that Poſition; and this for one, that
if God did intend the Salvation of all Men, by the Death of
Chriſt, then He did intend to give ſufficient meanes unto all
men for their Salvation: Now the Reſult of that Diſpute was
this, that when Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> came to urge a Scripture in <hi>Acts</hi>
14. <hi>That the Heathen were left without the Goſpell, and that
they had but ſhowers and fruitfull Seaſons, to diſcover a God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> was pleaſed to ſay thus; that he would
undertake to prove, that ſuch ſhowers and fruitfull Seaſons, did
diſcover a Mediator; which he undertaking to doe; Truly it
made me very earneſt, and deſirous, to heare how he could do
it; Becauſe I am going into a darke Country, where there is
want of the Goſpell; and if he could have could or informed
me how the <hi>Sun, Moone,</hi> and <hi>Starres</hi> teach the Goſpell, <hi>I</hi>
ſhould be very glad to have heard it: But I take notice of this,
that now Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> inſtead of proving that; he ſtates his
queſtion another way: And ſo M. <hi>Sympſon</hi> takes it as he ſtates
it. Now the diſpute this day (contrary to our expectation)
wherein <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> undertaking to prove, that <hi>God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſufficient meanes unto the Heathen for their Salvation,</hi> he
hath urged it by two Arguments: The firſt was from, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 4. Where the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>who will have all Men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> Now M. <hi>Sympſon</hi>
denied that Argument with this diſtinction, that there is a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretive</hi>
and a <hi>Preceptive,</hi> Will in God: There was ſomething
elſe concerning the Word [<hi>all] and Praying for all:</hi> Now I
ſhall deſire to take notice of two things; firſt, that M. <hi>Sympſon</hi>
might have denied the ſequell of the major Propoſition, which
was that the Apoſtle commands them <hi>to Pray for thoſe that are
in Authority, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore it muſt follow that they muſt
Pray for all others: For the Apoſtle gives the Reaſon why they
ſhould Pray for all that are in Authority; <hi>that they might lead a
peaceable, and quiet life under them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:114759:59"/>
The ſecond Argument which <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> urged was this:
If Jeſus Chriſt gave Himſelf a Ranſome for all, then He gave
the meanes of Salvation to all: But He gave Himſelf a Ranſome
for all, <hi>ergo.</hi> Now there is <hi>falacia dicti</hi> there; for the Word
all, is well known to be taken for all ſorts; and ſometimes for
a great number, and not for all men: As in <hi>Luke 2. Hebrewes</hi>
2. <hi>He Died for all,</hi> that is for all ſorts of men. <hi>I</hi> have but two
words more to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>I</hi> deſire you to conſider this, how <hi>Mr. Goodwin.</hi> hath
run Himſelf, (although a good Saylor,) and loſt his Ship in the
Sands.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, conſider withall how he doth deny his own ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which he acknowledged the laſt time, namely that there
were Decrees in God from Eternity; and that He ſaid that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
did reſpect ſtates of men from Eternity, and not perticular
Perſons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I deſire you to take notice of a good Obſervation,
that <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> hath in one of his Bookes, namely, that one
error leads unto many others, and hath many kindred: As a
man that marries a Wife, hath many Kindred that relate to
him by meanes thereof: So <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> houlding this error,
many other errors, Coſen Germain to it, will come in, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon it, which he muſt maintaine. And <hi>I</hi> deſire to ſpeake
only this as the ſum of what <hi>I</hi> have to ſay, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall finiſh it
in two words; to deſire the Congregation, firſt, to examine
thoſe Scriptures which have been urged on either ſide; and ſo
to deſire the Lord to give them His Spirit, to helpe them to the
right underſtanding thereof: And ſecondly, that this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
would conſider that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is ſingular in his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(for any thing <hi>I</hi> know) in diſtinguiſhing between the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of God, and the Object of His Decrees; for there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ancient and moderne Writers againſt him. Thirdly, <hi>I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to conſider this, that theſe Poſitions of his, which may
ſeem to cary a great ſtroke in the World; they are no new things;
for many others before him, have urged them with as much
ſtrength of Argument, as <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> (though very able)
can doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:114759:59"/>
And laſtly I deſire this, that if ſo be the Lord hath been pleaſed
to perſwade you, either this time or the laſt, that hereafter you
would not ſuffer, either Satan, or his inſtruments to draw you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
from the ancient and pure Goſpel, which teaches Jeſus Chriſt
unto you: For I profeſſe if that be truth, that the Sun, Moon,
and Starrs do preach a Mediator; I profeſſe that both I and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more are to learn Jeſus Chriſt from them; and I might appeal
to M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf, whether he hath ever learned a Mediator
from them or no.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>You have taken liberty to ſpeake your mind in
<hi>folio:</hi> and among others, that contradiction of yours is evident,
in ſaying that I was <hi>ſingular in my opinion,</hi> when immediately in
the next words, you add, that <hi>I ſaid nothing but what was ſaid of
old, and what other men uſe to ſay:</hi> And here I add, that all that I
hold in theſe controverſies about the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of it,</hi> and the <hi>power of believing</hi> given unto men, and ſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters, as of <hi>perſonall Election</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what were held generally by the Churches of Chriſt
for the firſt 300. years next after Chriſt: and there were none of
your opinion then heard of, or acknowledged in the world: and
<hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaking about election upon foreſeene Faith, in his
23. chap. of 3. book of his Inſtitutions; Sect. 1. he ſaith, <hi>that the
time of this opinion which was for the firſt 300. yeares after Chriſt</hi>
(which according to the ſenſe of all Divines, were the pureſt
times of the Church) and wherein there were the leaſt inrodes,
and incroachments made by errors upon ſaving truths, the great
truths of the Goſpell) <hi>There was no noiſe in the least of any ſuch
opinion, by thoſe that were accounted Orthodox in thoſe daies.</hi> And
this is acknowledged (upon the matter) by all our late learned
writers, to this very day; it is known unto all thoſe that have but
a little knowledge in books, that all the Reformed Proteſtants,
that are of that way called <hi>Lutheran</hi> (who are not inferiour to
thoſe that follow <hi>Calvin;</hi> neither for number, nor learning, nor
parts, nor zeal) all theſe generally (it may be ſome few, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
number excepted) they all ſtand up for that opinion
which I now hold, nay, even the Miniſters themſelves among us,
that are here in the City, and they that plead ſo fiercely againſt
this opinion; I may ſay as the Roman Oratour ſaid concerning
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114759:60"/>
civill Juſtice, <hi>It is ſo neceſſary, that even theeves, who live by inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
could not hold together without it, nor want it in their own ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
So I ſay, theſe truths about the <hi>Vniverſality of the death of
Christ,</hi> and the power which God hath given <hi>unto all men, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
unto ſalvation,</hi> they are ſo eſſentially and abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
that thoſe very perſons themſelves, who declare to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they cannot well ſpeak any thing, not preach a Sermon,
nor write a book, but they muſt give teſtimony to this truth: I
deſire to give you but a taſt only of two inſtances. The firſt is,
what M. <hi>Powell</hi> himſelf hath lately preached, in one of the
greateſt Auditories in the City (which alſo he hath ſince printed)
In the 39. and 40. <hi>pages</hi> of the ſaid book, he makes this objection

of the <hi>ungodly,</hi> one of the <hi>world,</hi> what plea can you make againſt
this? Why object you ſuch an objection againſt your ſelves? If a
pardon be ſent from a Prince to a company of priſoners, and the
meſſenger ſaith unto them in generall, here is a pardon for you,
from the Prince, for what you have done againſt him, come, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of it, and you ſhall be free. Now if one ſhould ask, is the
pardon for me? and another queſtion, is the pardon for me?
He would anſwer, it is for you that are priſoners, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
if you accept of it. A pardon is now ſent unto you,
that are ſinfull men and women, who are priſoners under the
power of Satan, and ſin; I ſay to you all, the Lord Jeſus hath ſent
forth his Pardon, which runs thus: <hi>I the Lord Jeſus, the Son of
God, and the Saviour of ſinners, out of my free grace,</hi> and mercy,
rich love and pity, am willing to pardon, and forgive, the ſins
and tranſgreſſions of you all, and this I will do really, if you wil
come in, and lay hold of this Pardon, and of my Righteouſneſſe.
Will a ſinner now ſay, doth Jeſus Chriſt meane me, ſeeing he
ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever comes unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt him out, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114759:60"/>
whoſoever believes on me, he ſhall be pardoned and ſaved?</hi> This
word <hi>whoſoever</hi> comprehends all, and excludes none; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
object not againſt your ſelves, neither refuſe your owne
ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Oh! but though Chriſt invites all, and makes promiſes
to all that do come, yet he intends not that all ſhould be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. My beloved,</hi> Think you that Chriſts intentions, and
his expreſſions are not one as reall as another? I tell you (and
you may believe it) that <hi>he intends to pardon all, and to ſave all,
as he expreſſeth it:</hi> He ſaith not the words only, but his heart
is ſo alſo. But mark it well, and miſtake me not, I do not mean
that he ſaith abſolutely, <hi>I'le pardon all, and ſave all,</hi> and no
more: Oh, no; but he ſpeaks conditionally, <hi>I'le pardon you all,
and ſave you all,</hi> if you believe on me, and accept of my
pardon.</p>

               <p>A ſecond inſtance which I would read unto
you is out of a ſmall Treatiſe, publiſhed by moſt of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in the City (two and fifty in number) out of a pretence
to give teſtimony to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt againſt errors and
hereſies: Pag. 32. <hi>Thouſands and ten thouſands of poore ſouls, which
Christ hath ranſomed with his blood, ſhall hereby be betrayed, ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and indangered to be undone to all eternity.</hi> Firſt, here is the
Doctrine of univerſall Redemption fully aſſerted, inaſmuch as
they that are ranſomed by the blood of Chriſt, are ſaid to be
in danger of being undone to all eternity: For danger implies
not a poſſibility only, but a probability and likelihood of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into, and ſuffering what they are in danger of: Now if the
ranſomed of Chriſt may be in danger of periſhing, then the
ranſomed are not the elect only in your ſenſe, but they that
periſh, and conſequently, all men. I could bring you twenty
other inſtances beſides theſe, which do aſſert, preach, and affirm
(and that conſtantly from day to day) the very ſelf-ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Concluſions which now they quarrell with, and make
ſuch matter of Errour and Hereſie of, and things of ſuch a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114759:61"/>
dangerous nature; I ſay, they cannot preach without them,
nor write without them.</p>

               <speaker>M. Cranford.</speaker>
               <p>Concerning theſe questions that have been diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
you all hear the Arguments that have been brought, and
how they have been anſwered; I add nothing to that. M. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
hath told you, that all the Churches and Teachers of the
Churches, for the firſt 300. years after Chriſt, taught no other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
but what he teaches concerning Election, Redemption, Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Grace, and ſuch like. Now here I make this Propoſition
unto him, let him but name one Father within 300. years after
Chriſt that taught all theſe Doctrines, and I will yeeld the truth of
the Argument; <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the fourth Book of the Eccleſiaſticall
Story ſpeaking of the death of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> tells us this ſtory, that
the Jewes did intreat the Governour, that they might have the body
of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> leſt the people ſhould turne away from following of
Christ to worſhip him: Theſe are the words of the whole Church
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> for (ſaith he) they were ignorant, that we could not
turne from Chriſt, <hi>not that died for all the world, but onely
for all thoſe that were ſaved out of the world.</hi> This was the
Doctrine then preached, it would be too long to go over all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas he cites that all the Lutherans were of his
Opinion, who were as many, and as learned and zealous as others;
I ſay againe, let him looke upon the writings of <hi>Horſinius</hi> againſt
<hi>Huburnus,</hi> (who was much of his Opinion) and ſpecially of <hi>Sopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
a briefe catalogue and conſent of the Lutheran Divines,
and I believe that Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> or any others who can examine
theſe bookes, they will be of another mind. And for that which
be cites out of Mr. <hi>Powell,</hi> he is able to anſwer for himſelfe; but this
I diſcerne, that he skipt that which would give light to all the
buſineſſe, (though he did earneſtly intreat him that it might
be read.) —</p>

               <speaker>M. Cranford.</speaker>
               <p>For that paſſage which he cites out of a book writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Ministers of the City of London, in their teſtimony againſt
Errors and Hereſies; I confeſſe my hand is to it: I ſay <hi>M. Goodwin</hi>
makes a very ill uſe of that, to think that it conduces any way to his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114759:61"/>
opinion: It's true we ſay this, that there may be a danger of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thouſands for whom Chriſt died, by broaching thoſe errors and
ſchiſmes: But this doth not infer, that therefore they for whom Chriſt
died may periſh, no more then that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid (Acts 27.) <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
theſe abide in the ſhip ye cannot be ſaved:</hi> Though God had
promiſed them all their lives, yet were in danger of periſhing, if they
ſtayed not in the ſhip. We may ſay, and we do teach a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between the means and the end; that is, between faith and
ſalvation; and ſo between unbelief and destruction: and this is no
hinderance, but that we may ſay, that ſuch a thing <hi>in natura ſua</hi> is
apt to produce ſuch an end: though in reſpect of the over-ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and counſell of God, it ſhall never do it. So theſe Errors and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
are in their own nature apt and fit to destroy, and drown ſoules
in perdition, (even thoſe for whom Chriſt died,) though God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
ſo to guide them by his grace, and holy Spirit, and to lead them
into all truth, that the evill one ſhall not touch them, but that they
ſhall perſevere finally unto the end: There is a connexion between
the means and the end: things may be apt and fit to indanger ſoules
in reſpect of ſecond cauſes, though there be no poſſibility for them to
miſcarry by them.</p>

               <p>I have onely a word or two to ſpeak more, and
ſo I have done. Whereas you pleaſe to ſay, that I skipt in
M. <hi>Powells</hi> Book, I profeſſe I did not skip one word ſo farre as I
read: That M. <hi>Powell</hi> may be of another mind in ſome other
place (perhaps neare at hand) I deny not: And ſo I ſay, that
theſe men are ſo contradictious and inconſitent with themſelves,
that it is a ſhame that men of learning, and parts, ſhould ſpeak
at ſuch a rate of contradiction as they do from time to time. And
for that which you ſay concerning this, that there was never a
Father, for the firſt 300. yeares after Chriſt that was of my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you give that to Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> and Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> that they would
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114759:62"/>
not have given to you. But I ſhall give an account of that to the
world in due time: And as for the Lutherans, that they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(I did not ſay all) hold theſe opinions, you may read Dr. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
he ſtill joyns together the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> in
theſe Queſtions, as his joynt adverſaries.</p>
